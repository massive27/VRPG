BUG LIST

- village teleportation bringing back to life eaten people, also allowing to get infinite skill point.
- Squirm skill learning from Jeritia may unbalance the game.
- naga class inflated belly glitch
- Healing fountain not restoring combat point (may be a feature, will have to look how behave the code before fixing)
- Monster may spawn in wall
- Adding a list of "eaten monsters" for fun facts and skill point checking (doing the list of non-vored one will be hard) ADDED
- Check on description of some permacast spell, adding missing one (may be out of code, so out of my range!)
- inedible stuff : loot in Abandoned Temple

- spawning in a map, within a deadend (no exit) space (Revx_Z, *known*)
- having level 1 Eleandra the Sorceress instead of the loaded savegame (Avant)
- saving and loading only loads the first ever save out of the savegame file (warbrand4)
- spawned pets does not eat after the first screen(level) you spawn them on (Heady9)
- Allanna's hiring some mercenaries, the options menu doesnt let hiring all "options" (Throku, Revx_Z)
- scroll selling from Melanca doesnt work on All-Dye (Revx_Z)
- not all temporary files deleted (Revx_Z, Throku) FIXED
- startup screen crash if "load game" then "cancel" selected (Revx_Z) FIXED
- talking to potion salesperson, inputting non-numerical data cause game crash (Revx_Z) FIXED
- skillicon-ChargedStrike.jpg failed to be extracted on time, causing err53 crash (Revx_Z)
- autosave doesn't save mercenaries / autosave happening when buying merc, going other map and exiting (Revx_Z) FIXED / FAILED
- more than 9999 potion makes screen glitch / not enough space (Revx_Z)



WONT BE FIXED
- VTDATAConversations.txt disappears when exiting the game / impossible to fix dialogues (Revx_Z)
==> this is a feature. If you want to modify Conversations.txt, make it as a mod
- respawn yourself after being utterly digested (NekoYuki, *known*)
==> since it is possible only with cheat code, it wont be fixed. That's what cheats are for ;)
- inedible stuff : Zettia in Home City
==> feature out of Duam's original game design
- Likayasha's conversation loophole allowing to get enchanted potion twice, after killing the Giantess
==> error in .txt, not source code
- inconsistency on map edge texture 
==> it looks like a feature in the code, i dont plan to fix that one


IMPROVEMENTS WHISHLIST

- Adding check-against-skill for Conversation (i think Duam didnt do it because it is difficult, due to how the game handle skills)
- Adding dummy graphics for extra monster (not required. The code for MONTYP4 will include many changes) (Revx_Z)
- Possibilty of continue game after the win even / Trisha kill, including checkpoint for Mod support. DONE
- Activating the keypad "5" for "stand still" (may be a gameplay exploit, dunno if i'll do it) (Revx_Z)
- Adding sanity checks in the magic item generation to avoid nonsense (Revx_Z)
- Adding a "error 430" handling to lead the user on how to fix it (missing d3drm.dll)
- Belly streching rendered without the weapon to avoid a glitch (Revx_Z)
- changing on how Eating villagers' feature works.
- Eating villagers' too quick (should add the same digestion routine for npc, with dice roll on escape attempt, etc... also when PC is eaten by a villager)
- adding a "revoke" spell to dismiss summoned creatures
- better pathfinding, especially when monster is attacked (Revx_Z)
- Enlarging the overall game size
- Adding a MONTYP4 parameter for more in-depth tuning and modding of the game (full specification must be validated first) (Throku)
- reformations pods, once used, let the player respawn if killed. Inventory emptied (warbrand4)
- Neko outfit for characters (NekoYuki)
- MOD, use Conversations-[wildcard].txt first then Conversations.txt to seek dialogue for people (Revx_Z)
- more easily modifiable file format (xml or openoffice) (wsensor)
- conversation screen : picture centered in the middle, text on the left, option on the right (Throku)
