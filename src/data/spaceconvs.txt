#NEWS, #MONSTEREATRumors
#NEWSSTR, Did you see the news last night?  A $STARSHIPTYPE from $FACTION got swallowed whole by a $SPACEMONSTER!  It's probably still digesting them!  Man/ I'm sure glad I wasn't on that ship...
#NEWSSTR, I heard that $FACTION just lost one of their ships to a $SPACEMONSTER.  Those things sure have mean appetites.  They can $DIGEST a whole starship in days/ and that usually includes the crew...

#FOUNDORE rumors
Have you been around $OREPLANET lately?  I've heard there's tons of $PLANETORE there.  Unfortunately/ the hungry $PLANETMONSTERs have kept anyone from mining it...
I just heard that space scouts have reported a giant deposit of $PLANETORE on $OREPLANET!  They lost contact with the scouts just after the report...doubtless they're churning in some $PLANETMONSTER's $BELLY...
There's some sort of new deposit of $PLANETORE on $OREPLANET.  I'm sure the miners will be heading out there soon/ though I imagine most will end up as dinner for the $PLANETMONSTERs...
A news report recently stated that a scouting party has located high levels of $PLANETORE on $OREPLANET.  Of course/ what they didn't mention was the fact that they also found high levels of $PLANETMONSTERS/ which found high levels of nutrition in most of the scouting party...
I've heard there's a $PLANETORE rush going on around $OREPLANET.  If you're in the mining business/ you might want to take a look.

#NEWS, #MONSTERSRumors
#NEWSSTR, I just came in from $PLANETNAME.  There are $PLANETMONSTERs there that can $EAT a woman whole faster than you can pull a blaster on them.  And their $POOP smells awful!
#NEWSSTR, I heard there's all kinds of $PLANETMONSTERs on $PLANETNAME.  They've been $EATING all of the scouting parties that have tried to survey the planet!
#NEWSSTR, Man/ I'm getting sick of the monsters everywhere.  It's like you can't take one step out of a starbase without falling down something's throat.  Why/ just last month/ I heard one of my ex-shipmates was swallowed whole by a $PLANETMONSTER on $PLANETNAME!  It's insane/ the voraciousness of the food chain around here...

#ARTIFACT Rumors
I've heard there's some sort of artifacts on $ARTIFACTPLANET.  I don't know if it's true/ but I'm sure there must be some very hungry monsters there if nobody has already taken the artifacts...
Have you heard of $ARTIFACTPLANET?  I've heard there is some sort of archeological anomoly there/ some sort of artifacts.  It might be worth checking out/ if you're an explorer.
I've heard that some factions have begun sending secret exploratory teams to $ARTIFACTPLANET.  I wouldn't be surprised if there were some sort of valuable artifacts there.

#NEWS, #WARRumors
#NEWSSTR, I heard that $FACTION1 just conquered $PLANETTAKEN!  Man/ $FACTION2 isn't going to last much longer...
#NEWSSTR, Have you heard?  $FACTION2 is getting it's ass kicked by $FACTION1.  They just conquered $PLANETTAKEN.
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION1 has just conquered $PLANETTAKEN from $FACTION2.  $FACTION2 hasn't even been able to muster a counterattack.
#NEWSSTR, There's still a battle going on between $FACTION1 and $FACTION2.  They're practically at each other's throats.  Or/ rather/ IN each other's throats.  $FACTION1 just took $PLANETTAKEN from them/ though.
#NEWSSTR, I just heard that $FACTION1 conquered $FACTION2 planet of $PLANETTAKEN.
#NEWSSTR, Well/ $FACTION1 is at it again.  They just took $PLANETTAKEN from $FACTION2.

NEWSSTR, I've heard $FACTION1 is at war with $FACTION2!  Man/ you get those two together/ and you know somebody's gonna $EAT somebody...
NEWSSTR, There's some sort of war going on between $FACTION1 and $FACTION2.  I wish they'd just $EAT each other and get it over with.


War rumors part 2
#NEWS, #WARRumors
#NEWSSTR, And now with $PLANETTAKEN conquered/ $FACTION2 is going to have a really hard time defending themselves.
#NEWSSTR, Next we'll be hearing that $FACTION1 has conquered $FACTION2's homeworld...
#NEWSSTR, Now it's only a matter of time before $FACTION2 is totally wiped out.
#NEWSSTR, Now $FACTION1 flag flies over $PLANETTAKEN.
#NEWSSTR, With $PLANETTAKEN now in the hands of $FACTION1/ $FACTION2 has been trying to mount a counterattack.
#NEWSSTR, It's only a matter of time before $FACTION2 retaliates/ though.
#NEWSSTR, I wonder how this war is going to turn out.  For all we know/ $FACTION1 may end up being the ones to churn in the stomachs of $FACTION2's leaders...
#NEWSSTR, I don't give much for $FACTION2's odds.
#NEWSSTR, Don't think $FACTION1 has got it made/ though.  $FACTION2 is putting up a fierce fight.

#NEWS, #RANDOMRumors
#NEWSSTR, So/ are you new around here?
#NEWSSTR, Seen any good flicks lately?
#NEWSSTR, Have you gotten any cybernetics?  Man/ they're great!  They make you stronger/ faster/ and way tougher/ without weighing you down or anything!  The only trouble is/ only a few people can really afford them...especially the advanced ones.
#NEWSSTR, You're a captain/ huh?  Watch out for space monsters.  Ships are constantly being swallowed whole by the merciless beasts--they digest the ship with it's crew still inside!
#NEWSSTR, If you're ever swallowed by a space monster/ you'll have to get out of your ship and attack the pelvic splanknic ganglian.  This will force an involuntary spasm in the monster's gastrointestinal tract/ freeing your ship.  Unfortunately/ getting to it almost invariably means traversing the monster's digestive tract on foot/ which is not exactly the safest proposition...
#NEWSSTR, I can't wait until I can afford some cybernetics.  They make people strong and fast/ and don't weigh you down like armor does.  You should get some for yourself.
#NEWSSTR, Be sure to read the consumer reviews before you ever commit to buying a new ship.  The sales pitches may make a particular ship class sound tantalizing/ but you're just setting yourself up to get ripped off if you don't check into it yourself.
#NEWSSTR, Let me give you a bit of advice.  When equipping your starship/ make sure you keep in mind what you intend to do with it.  Not every ship can be strong/ fast/ heavily armed and have a huge cargo hold all at once.  You'll have to make some trade-offs with your upgrades/ so make sure you keep everything in balance according to your profession.
#NEWSSTR, Man/ this area is crawling with pirates.  I never liked them.  I mean sure/ a lot of them are sexy/ but it seems like you can't fly half a mile without having a dozen of the heavily-armed bimbos coming after you...
#NEWSSTR, Watch out for pirates.  I've heard they're all over the place.  The only thing they like better than looting starships is $EATING their captains whole.

Say/ you're the captain of the $SHIPNAME/ aren't you?

News

#NEWS, #MONSTEREAT
#NEWSSTR, The leaders of $FACTION sighed in frustration again today when one of their vessels was swallowed whole by a $SPACEMONSTER.  $FACTION has been unsuccessful in their attempts to intercept the beast/ and experts say the ship is doubtless digested beyond repair by now.  This doubtless includes the vessel's brave crew/ who gave their lives to fatten the hideous $SPACEMONSTER.  
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION traffic was stopped in one sector a short time ago due to reports that the starship $STARSHIPNAME was $EATEN by a marauding $SPACEMONSTER. The $STARSHIPTYPE-class vessel was no match for the $SPACEMONSTER's hungry jaws/ and it was $EATEN almost instantly.
#NEWSSTR, A $STARSHIPTYPE-class starship was $EATEN whole last week by a $SPACEMONSTER/ the latest in a practically endless string of military ships being $EATEN by space monsters.  Every ship in the sector was put on alert/ and $FACTION/ the previous owners of the ship/ have stepped up their defenses in the sector.

'Monster part 2
#NEWS, #MONSTEREAT
#NEWSSTR, An expedition is planned by $FACTION to hunt down the beast before it claims any more of $FACTION's ships.  Their warships should be adequate for the task/ though many fear they will simply end up sliding down the $SPACEMONSTER's intestines alongside the last ship.
#NEWSSTR, When asked about a potential response to this threat/ a spokeswoman for $FACTION said 'I'm afraid we cannot afford to mount a response at this time.  Space creatures $EAT starships every day/ and it's just something you have to account for in your fleet maneuvers.'
#NEWSSTR, The crew's fate was confirmed yesterday when a deep space exploration team discovered a large mass of $SPACEMONSTER excrement tumbling through space.  Trace evidence consisting of small/ undigested flecks of starship hull and bone confirmed the fate of the $STARSHIPNAME.
#NEWSSTR, It is believed that the crew of the $STARSHIPNAME are still alive and undergoing digestion within the depths of the $SPACEMONSTER.  A rescue attempt is impossible at this point/ however/ as every ship to approach the $SPACEMONSTER has been either driven off or $EATEN whole.
#NEWSSTR, Sightings of $SPACEMONSTERs have been on the rise ever since captain $RANDOMNAME's ship was $EATEN several months ago.  $SPACEMONSTERs have been $EATING freighters/ scouts and warships alike/ prompting many citizen's groups to call for serious action against the $SPACEMONSTER's lairs.

'Monster part 3
#NEWS, #MONSTEREAT
#NEWSSTR, '$FACTION really needs to pay more attention to these threats' said expert analyst $RANDOMNAME.  'If they had paid proper attention to their anti-$SPACEMONSTER defenses/ this never would have happened.  I think the digestion of the $STARSHIPNAME's crew should serve as a serious wakeup call to $FACTION.'
#NEWSSTR, 'The ship never really had a chance/' said $RANDOMNAME/ a purported witness of the apparent devouring.  'I mean/ the $STARSHIPNAME was a plenty sturdy ship/ but a $STARSHIPTYPE-class ship like her really has no chance against that big of a $SPACEMONSTER.  They were food the second they were spotted.'
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION's leaders were quick to downplay the threat posed by the $SPACEMONSTER. "There is nothing to worry about/" said $RANK $RANDOMNAME/ an officer in $FACTION navy.  "The devouring of the $STARSHIPNAME was really just bad luck.  This is not indicative of a greater threat to $FACTION or it's fleets."  Rumors of several other ships having been $EATEN by $SPACEMONSTERs as of the time of the interview were quickly dismissed as preposterous.
#NEWSSTR, '$SPACEMONSTERs have been a serious problem for everyone ever since we ventured into space/' said $RANK $RANDOMNAME/ a spokeswoman for $FACTION.  'If any of us have any brains/ we'd stop eating each other and spend the time hunting down these monsters who are eating ALL of us.'  Opponents of $FACTION have labeled this stance as hypocritical/ saying 'They really should put their money where their mouth is/ so to speak.  They haven't exactly stopped swallowing US to help us fight space monsters.'
#NEWSSTR, $RANDOMNAME/ a scholar who advises numerous factions on anti-monster protocol/ had a fairly clear interpretation of the event.  'Nobody has been able to pull off a successful strike against the $SPACEMONSTER's lairs/' she said in a recent interview. 'So long as their breeding grounds remain intact/ their feeding grounds will too.  They'll keep $EATING our ships until we wipe them out.'

'Monster part 4

#NEWSSTR, The $SPACEMONSTER could not be reached for comment.
#NEWSSTR, Salvage operations are scheduled to begin on the remains of the $STARSHIPNAME as soon as the $SPACEMONSTER $POOPs out the rest of it.
#NEWSSTR, There are anecdotal reports of a fattened $SPACEMONSTER lounging about the area/ belching contentedly.
#NEWSSTR, That's all for the news/ and now on to sports...
#NEWSSTR, Now in lighter news...

#NEWS, #WAR
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION2Z leaders met today to discuss their latest setback in their war with $FACTION1/ the military loss of the planet $PLANETTAKEN in a prolonged assault on $FACTION2Z positions.  
#NEWSSTR, The ongoing war between $FACTION1 and $FACTION2 took a turn for the worse today as $PLANETTAKEN came under full assault.  $FACTION1Z forces swarmed all over the planet/ destroying key defensive installations and devouring dozens of hapless $FACTION2Z defenders.  The battle ended quickly/ with $FACTION1 reigning victorious over the world as they digested the hapless members of $FACTION2.
#NEWSSTR,News of a full-scale attack on $PLANETTAKEN was recieved today/ the latest in a string of aggressive acts in the ongoing war between $FACTION1 and $FACTION2.  $FACTION2 defended $PLANETTAKEN with all they could against the $FACTION1Z onslaught/ but in the end they were driven off the planet.  $PLANETTAKEN is now in $FACTION1Z hands.
#NEWSSTR, In a surprise attack by $FACTION1/ the planet $PLANETTAKEN was assaulted and subsequently overrun.  Fleets of $FACTION1Z girls attacked the planet/ $EATING the defenders and establishing a beachhead which was then pressed forward until the $FACTION2Z command center was conquered.
#NEWSSTR, Sad news for $FACTION2 today as the planet $PLANETTAKEN was conquered by $FACTION1.  The lightning attack by $FACTION1Z forces pressed the $FACTION2Z girls back to their emergency defense points/ and they were forced to retreat when their commander was $EATEN whole by a $FACTION1Z assassin.
#NEWSSTR, A tremendous battle took place on the planet $PLANETTAKEN today/ as $FACTION1 continued their ongoing war against $FACTION2.  The fierce attack ended with the conquering of $PLANETTAKEN and the retreat of the $FACTION2Z forces.
#NEWSSTR, News has just reached us of an assault on the planet $PLANETTAKEN by $FACTION1.  Reports indicate that they have successfully wrested control of the planet from $FACTION2/ which on last sighting was in full retreat.
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION1 has announced that they have conquered the $FACTION2Z planet of $PLANETTAKEN.  Their official announcement stated "We have liberated $PLANETTAKEN from the unsavory forces of $FACTION2.  Those who resisted are currently experiencing digestion in our $BELLIES."
#NEWSSTR, Ferocious fighting took place recently on $FACTION2 planet of $PLANETTAKEN.  $FACTION1 sent an assault fleet in an attempt to take the planet with military force.  Eyewitnesses report scenes of unbelievable gluttony on the part of the $FACTION1Zs/ $EATING $FACTION2 girls with reckless abandon.

'War part 2
#NEWS, #WAR
#NEWSSTR, Ships from both sides suffered heavy casualties in the prolonged battle/ but in the end $FACTION2 was driven from $PLANETTAKEN and $FACTION1 is busy building defenses to keep the planet under their control.
#NEWSSTR, Losses were heavy on the $FACTION1Z side/ but they kept coming and eventually the defenders were overwhelmed.  The blocking of reinforcements by $FACTION1Z fleets made sure the planet would be theirs.
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION2 plans a counterattack to retake $PLANETTAKEN/ but their battered forces have been slow to mobilize in taking the offensive back to $FACTION1Z space.  $FACTION1/ meanwhile/ continues to press the attack further and further into $FACTION2Z territory.
#NEWSSTR, With $PLANETTAKEN now in the hands of $FACTION1/ $FACTION2 will be hard pressed to continue their war efforts.  Experts suggest that this will prove to be a serious blow to $FACTION2/ and if losses like this continue/ their conquering by $FACTION1 is almost inevitable.
#NEWSSTR, Casualties on the $FACTION1Z side were practically nonexistant--the biggest hazard to their troops came when massively overstuffed $FACTION1Z girls had to retreat from battle in order to digest the huge numbers of $FACTION2Z girls they had eaten.  Overall/ it was a crushing (and dissolving) defeat for $FACTION2.  Their ships have retreated from the area around $PLANETTAKEN in order to defend more crucial targets nearby.
#NEWSSTR, With the military of $PLANETTAKEN reduced to $FACTION1Z $POOP/ $FACTION2 will need to consolidate their remaining forces before any counterattack will be possible.  $FACTION2's leaders have vowed that/ no matter how many of their girls they have to throw into the bellies of the enemy/ they will fight until they are victorious.
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION1's losses were quite heavy/ however/ and some believe the attack may have been more costly than it was worth.  Many retreating $FACTION2Z girls were seen trying to run with their sloshing bellies grossly overfilled with the squirming bodies of $FACTION1Z attackers.
#NEWSSTR, $FACTION1 did not come out of the battle totally unscathed/ however.  Many of their warriors reported 'mild intestinal discomfort' as they digested the legions of $FACTION2Z girls who had previously been defending the planet.
#NEWSSTR, The planet itself took minor ecological damage in the battle/ as much of the terrain is now covered in girl $POOP.  "I don't think $FACTION1 respects the damage they are doing to the environment/" said $RANDOMNAME/ a local news columnist.  "I mean/ they were just shitting wherever they felt like it/ leaving huge mounds of $POOP all over the landscape.  And considering how big those $FACTION2Z girls were/ that's a whole lot of $POOP to clean up."  A spokeswoman for $FACTION1 responded to $RANDOMNAME by unloading a plump log of $POOP all over her.
#NEWSSTR, $RANDOMNAME/ a columnist who has been following the $FACTION1Z-$FACTION2Z conflict since it began/ offered her commentary on this disaster.  "Obviously/ $FACTION1 had the upper hand in this fight/" she started.  "Those $FACTION1Z girls were well-trained/ well-armed/ and practically starving.  They fell upon $FACTION2 like banshees--it's amazing they survived as long as they did.  Once the digestion began/ I don't think anyone was surprised at the outcome."
#NEWSSTR, '$FACTION1 won't be defeating us as easily as they think,' said $RANK $RANDOMNAME/ an officer in $FACTION2's navy.  'We may have lost $PLANETTAKEN/ but we intend to win this war/ and if $FACTION1 thinks we'll just lie down and be $DIGESTED they're in for a very dangerous surprise.'
#NEWSSTR, The fighting was ferocious on both sides/ with both $FACTION1Z and $FACTION2Z forces taking heavy losses as their troops were mercilessly $EATEN whole.  $PLANETTAKEN's landscape is now covered in $POOP/ a grim reminder to both sides of the cost of this war.
