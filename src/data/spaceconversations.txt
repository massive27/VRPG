#CONVERSATION, Mission Briefing

#TEXT, "You stride onto the bridge of your vessel, steadying yourself for the task ahead.  The mission you are about to embark upon is dangerous; there is no telling if anyone will return from it.  Nonetheless, the survival of your faction depends on it, and you have volunteered to accompany the special task force fleet on this crucial operation."

#TEXT, "As the fleet begins to assemble, the communications section crackles to life.  You order that the message be displayed on the central viewscreen."

#BRANCH, INCOMING
#SAY, "INCOMING MESSAGE FROM CENTRAL COMMAND.  Re: Briefing for special operation into Vortex.  Standby for Admiral Tarala."
#CHOICE, (Recieve Message), BRIEFING

#BRANCH, BRIEFING
#SAY, "Attention, $FACTION commanders.  As you know, the territory of $FACTION has been coming under constant monster attack from the region called the Vortex.  The Vortex, at it's core, is an abnormally dense cluster of monster lairs which are spewing out hundreds of space monsters daily.  We believe this vortex to be unnatural, but have not been able to find any explaination for it as of yet.  Waves of these beasts have gradually begun cracking through our defenses, and now we realize it is only a matter of time before $FACTION falls before this onslaught."
#CHOICE, (Continue), MORE

#BRANCH, MORE
#SAY, "Long range reconaissance records indicate that a number of other militarized factions already border the other side of the Vortex.  We can only assume they have also come under attack from the beasts within.  We are sending your task force through the vortex to contact these other factions.  Your orders are to establish diplomatic relations with these factions, enlist their aid against the beasts, and find out anything they know about possible ways to destroy the vortex once and for all."
#CHOICE, (Continue), MORE2

#BRANCH, MORE2
#SAY, "The most difficult part of this mission will be breaking through the vortex to reach the other side.  We have enlisted only the finest combat captains to attempt this.  Once you have reached the other side, our diplomats will do the rest.  Your return through the Vortex will be at your own discretion, but be aware that we will be unable to support you once you reach the other side."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE3

#BRANCH,MORE3
#SAY, "That concludes this briefing.  Remember above all--we must find a way to ensure $FACTION's survival against the beasts.  Find allies and find a way to destroy the vortex."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE4

#BRANCH,MORE4
#TEXT, "With that, the viewscreen switches off.  The fleet moves into combat formation and prepares to enter the Vortex.  You activate your vessel's engines and ensure that your crew is at full combat status."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE5

#BRANCH,MORE5
#TEXT, "The first wave of monsters hits almost immediately as you enter the vortex region.  The fleet's firepower tears into the beasts, but even with the first wave several of them break through the line and attempt to clamp their jaws around your escorts.  The flagship makes a daring swing into the thick of battle and manages to repulse the beasts, but more are visible on long range sensors and closing fast.
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE6

#BRANCH,MORE6
#TEXT, "The fleet hits it's afterburners and attempts to outrun the beasts, but few can evade combat completely.  The battle stretches on for hours, with ship after ship finally succumbing to enemy fire and being eaten by the carnivorous monstrousities.  By the time you are finally approaching the edge of the vortex, all that remains is your own ship, the flagship, and a handful of escorts." 
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE7

#BRANCH,MORE7
#TEXT, "As you see the swarm of beasts begin to thicken, the flagship takes a severe hit to it's engines and is suddenly dragged back into the fray by the tentacles of a giant space octopus.  You dive in to try to save it but are held up by a whole squadron of great beasts.  Any one of them could swallow your entire ship whole, but nonetheless, you press the attack.  You see the flagship's final remaining escorts dissappear down the throats of the encroaching armada, and suddenly you recieve a desperate message from the flagship."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE8

#BRANCH,MORE8
#SAY, "Captain $NAME, this is Admiral Tarala!  Our engine core has been cracked and we're losing power!  We have just enough energy to maintain our main weapons batteries.  We're going to punch a hole through the beasts on your end, and your orders are to charge through the hole and make it out of the vortex!"
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE9

#BRANCH,MORE9
#TEXT, "Before you can argue, a massive wave of destructive energy bursts from the flagship, incinerating several of the smaller monsters near you and driving off the larger ones, leaving a relatively clear cooridor.  You can't bear to leave your commander in such a position, but even as you watch the flagship is dragged into the gigantic octopus' maw.  You gun the engines and head for the border, with slimey gobs of acid and spines from the attacking monsters thumping against your hull the whole way out.  Finally, in a burst of weapons fire, you crack through the edge of the vortex and lose the last of your pursuers."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE10

#BRANCH,MORE10
#TEXT, "As the monsters fade out of sensor range and you order damage control, you suddenly realize that you are the sole surviving member of your task force.  The entire mission--diplomacy, investigation of the vortex, and whatever else becomes necessary--now falls upon your shoulders.  With the loss of the flagship and the diplomatic corps aboard it, it's all up to you to find a way to save your faction."
#CHOICE, (Continue),MORE11

#BRANCH, MORE11
#TEXT, "Welcome to the Duamutef's Glorious Vore RPG Expansion!  You are a starship commander, and your mission is to find a way to stop the insidious Vortex from overrunning everything in this sector.  Your mission will require ingenuity, diplomacy, and a lot of raw firepower to achieve.  If you fail, the beasts of the vortex will devour all.  (Not that that would be a bad thing, but still.)  Good luck."

#CHOICE, (More), OTHERFACS

#BRANCH, OTHERFACS
#SAY, "To the galactic northwest is the Allied Star Protectorate, with whom we share a border and an excellent relationship.  They are also a defensive organization, and an honorable one.  East of here is Clan Ironbelly, which is right in the vortex's face.  They choose to bear the brunt of the monster's attacks in that area, and regularly stage assaults on the monster lairs to reduce their numbers.  They can be a little touchy, but are likewise honorable."

#SAY, "Further south, however, things turn ugly.  There is a faction called the Interstellar Assault Fleet which is embroiled in a giant war with three other factions.  The IAF was, and may still be, the most powerful faction in this region of space, but it's anyone's guess as to whether they can defeat all three.  Those three are the Star Matriarchy, the Demon Princesses and the Breasted Regime.  We're not particularly fond of any of them."

The Zadiian Raiders pop up in numerous places, and mostly just seem to want to raid lightly armed fleets so they can feed on their crews.  Zadiians have quite the appetite.

We are already allied with the Ironbelly Clan in their efforts to hold back the monsters of the vortex, though preserving our own internal security has prevented us from sending much aid to them.  Besides the monsters at our own gates, the wars in this region have prompted practically everyone to size up their enemies for weakness, and we cannot afford to display such."

Though wars and infighting are commonplace, it is very rare for the monsters to become this numerous or this dense.  We have conducted limited research into the phenomena, but have found nothing."

Both goals are difficult these days, what with the incessant wars between all the other factions and the fact that space monsters are growing almost daily.

The Interstellar Assault Fleet, another defensive organization like us, has been waging war against the Breasted Regime, Demon Princesses and the Star Matriarchy.  They obviously can't hold off all three, so the war has been turning against them.  They have not approached us for aid, likely because we have been busy holding off monsters with Clan Ironbelly.  The Enzyme Sisters and the Cult of Acid seem to be fighting off and on as well, though we know little of their reasons why.  We don't hear much from them around here."

We do hold some talks with Clan Ironbelly as well, and though they can be a bit touchy at times, they have been forthright in their dealings with us and their goal is a noble one.  A few other factions have proven to be considerably less friendly, but for the most part, we have few personal enemies in this region.  Few factions want to antagonize us into war against them when they already have so many other enemies and wars on their hands.

The war began when the IAF came into conflict with a smaller empire called the Breasted Regime, and would have ended fairly quickly had it not been for the intervention of the Demon Princesses and the Star Matriarchy.  Apparently they had both grown sick of the IAF, and saw the situation as an opportunity to knock them down to size...or digest them down to lumps, as it were.  The war could go either way at this point, but popular rumor has it that the IAF is suffering from fighting on three fronts."

We have pledged to hold off the monsters of beastspace for as long as possible, which is more than I can say for the other cowards in this region who see our pledge as an excuse to do nothing themselves.  Our ships possess the finest armor in the region, as we cannot afford to lose ships in a battle of attrition against the monsters.

#BRANCH, WEAKNESS
#SAY, "The biggest advantage that starships have over monsters is that very few monsters have any sort of shielding.  This means that they cannot disengage temporarily to recover damage, whereas you can.  The best way to deal with monsters is to make repeated hit and run attacks, making sure they can't inflict enough damage to get through your shields.  This is easier said than done, of course.  Most monsters are pretty maneuverable, and they'll stay on your tail until one of you is dead.  Another odd quirk monsters have is that they tend to be lousy dogfighters--though they're easily more agile than a starship, they'll often just run up to firing range and hold position there, where you can pound them senseless.  Just hold down the trigger until you're out of weapon energy, then zip off to let your shields recharge."

#BRANCH, POWERFUL
#SAY, "Well, we're not sure why, but these monsters have started to work together.  Usually monsters from different lairs fight amongst each other just as much as they fight starships--apparently other monsters are just as nutritious as we are.  The problem is, all the monsters in the vortex have stopped preying on one another entirely, and turned their full attention on us girls.  Without other monsters to satiate their appetites, their only source of food is us.  This has made them extremely aggressive, and without fighting one another, their numbers have grown far beyond what they would normally be."

#SAY, "Monsters live for only one thing--food.  To them, anything that flies the spaceways is nothing but a meal to be consumed and processed inside their cavernous guts.  They've learned that simply latching on and trying to suck down a full-sized warship doesn't always work, though, so they generally attempt to weaken them first.  We've seen monsters firing plasma bolts, lasers, and even smacking ships with their claws to weaken them enough to be devoured.  Once your ship is crippled, they'll gulp it down like a goldfish."

#BRANCH, ESCAPE
#SAY, "Well, there are still ways to save your ship once it's been swallowed by a monster.  If the monster was impatient and swallowed your ship while it still had power, you can just blast your way out, though you'll be losing shields and hull to their digestive juices until you do.  If they crippled your ship before they swallowed it, then you're in serious trouble, but there is still one thing you can do.  Inside each space monster is a cluster of nerves called the Pelvic Splancknic Ganglian.  If you can find these and give them a good whack, the monster will convulse and expel your ship from it's bowels prematurely.  Hopefully your crew will have had time to restore power by then."
#CHOICE, "And how do I find this...'Ganglian'?", GANGLIAN

#BRANCH, GANGLIAN
#SAY, "You'll have to leave your ship and explore the monster's innards.  This obviously isn't a safe thing to do, as you'll be fighting off digestive enzymes the whole time, but the only alternative is simply waiting for the enzymes to come to you.  Staying inside your ship is just prolonging the inevitable."

Theoretically a powerful enough mage could mind control a large number of monsters, but no one has ever been able to do so with more than a few dozen.

#BRANCH, SPACEGROUND
#SAY, "Well, it's mostly just a matter of size.  There's obvious differences in how they're adapted, but these mostly just reflect their environments.  Ground monsters have powerful melee attacks and some ground-based form of mobility, like legs, whereas space monsters are self-mobile and tend to possess missile attacks to use against the generally heavily-shielded and armored targets they encounter--generally either crewed starships or other space monsters.  The basic idiom of space and ground monsters is the same--they're both evolved to seek out prey, weaken it with direct attacks, and finally swallow it.  Since starships don't have arms or legs it can be harder to escape from them once swallowed, but the weapons in your ship can often blast their way out, since space monsters have weaker stomach defenses than the nigh-invincible ground ones."

#SAY, "There are a few other differences as well, obviously.  Monsters can't land on planets for the same reason that starships can't--the energy fields put out by planets interfere with starship engines, and space monster mobility is based on the same principle.  This keeps girls on planets safe from them, which is a good thing--a city-sized space amoeba is a hard monster to beat with a simple sword."

#SAY, "Well, monsters are like every other creature in that they reproduce on their own.  The difference is that monsters are essentially a lower form of life--they're simpler biologically than most girl species, and this means they can reproduce much faster and with less energy.  Girls can easily be stronger than monsters, but the imbalance in numbers means most girls who go gunning for fights in monster lairs don't live very long anyway.  Generally, only two things limit monster population--cities of girls like us, who fight them, and their tendency to prey on one another."

#BRANCH, MONWEAK
#SAY, "Well, that depends on the monster.  In general, it's easiest to kill monsters by simply attacking them.  Unlike us, when a monster gets hit one too many times, they tend to explode.  The biggest strategic choice is what kind of weapon to use against a particular monster--most monsters take extra damage when they are hit with a particular type of weapon.  Karis, for example, are best to fight with spears, because their maws are right around shoulder-height, and swinging a shorter weapon at them gives them ample chance to swallow you.  Slime vines, on the other hand, are vulnerable to the wide lateral slices that swords can make, severing dozens of stalks at once."
#CHOICE, (More), MONWEAK2

#BRANCH, MONWEAK2
#SAY, "Most flying creatures are hard to hit with normal weapons, so it's good to use bows and spells against them, and creatures who are armored but really don't like to be cut in half--like nagas or giant worms--are particularly vulnerable to axes.  Some beasts are even vulnerable to maces--particularly little squishy monsters like frogs or slimes.  And, generally speaking, almost all monsters are vulnerable to magic."

However, there are certain exceptions which appear to prevent them from hunting themselves to extinction.  First of all, while it differs between species, monsters of the same type tend not to attack one another unless they're from different geographical regions.  Monsters form 'families' of sorts in certain areas, and tend not to fight others from the same local area, even if they're different species.

#SAY, "I see.  My operatives have filed reports of the Vortex's growth, and I must acknowledge that it had concerned us.  However, destroying the vortex would require firepower beyond that possessed by any faction in this region, unless they were all to unite--which I see as highly unlikely."

We would gladly march in arms alongside any in this region for such a mission, but few would be willing to march alongside us--or anyone else.  Even if every faction in the region were to unite against the vortex, there is no guarantee that our might would be sufficient to destroy it."

#BRANCH, CAUSEEFFECT
#SAY, "We are uncertain as to the specific cause--there are several theories, all of which seem plausible.  There are many circumstances that can cause two monsters to consider themselves allies.  For one thing, any monsters spawned from the same lair will not attack one another.  For another, monsters summoned by a particular sorceress recognize their common allegiance and will not attack one another.  For a third, monsters can be charmed or mind-controlled, and lastly, some monsters are smart enough to be trained to recognize allies and enemies.  However, none of these explainations is enough to explain such a large-scale situation as the Vortex."

#SAY, "We are no more or less than we are.  We feel little need to claim allegiance to a narrow ideal or ruler to hold us together--we look out for our own, work to further our own interests and, when it suits us, the interests of others.  We seek no conflict, nor do we shirk or tolerate it when it is brought to us.  Our name comes from our origins--we grew from a cabal of mages and scientists who sought to understand the mysteries of digestion and it's seemingly prime relationship to the universe around us.  We like to think we have a singular understanding of that subject, though we have broadened our studies to include many other areas of knowledge as well."

#CHOICE, "Can I ask you something else?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, DIGESTION
#SAY, "Certainly.  Of course, most people would rather show you firsthand, but...*she chuckles*  Digestion is based on the alteration of natural energies.  Each person and monster has a reservoir of energies which are used to fuel and maintain their bodies.  These energies are what allow us to shrug off injuries with no visible effects.  If you hit a rock with a hammer, it will break, whereas if you hit a girl with a hammer, she may feel weakened but no visible damage is done.  These energies constantly replenish the body so it is effectively immune to physical damage."

#CHOICE, "Can I ask you something else?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, DIGESTION2
#SAY, "Since bodies heal themselves instantly using this energy, it becomes very difficult truly harm or destroy a girl--you would need to inflict damage faster than the body could heal it, which is all but impossible.  However, the average stomach is designed specifically to solve these problems.  The acids in the stomach cause constant damage to the skin, meaning there is a constant drain on the body's energy reserve, making it much harder to replenish since it has to concentrate on keeping the body intact while every inch of it is being dissolved.  The flesh in the stomach and adjoining organs also directly absorbs this energy by coaxing it out with heat and enzymes and drawing it into the stomach walls or intestinal linings."
#CHOICE, "Go on.", DIGESTION3
#CHOICE, "Er, this is kinda creeping me out...can we change the subject?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, DIGESTION3
#SAY, "Since energy is being both absorbed and stripped at the same time, most girls do not have the energy reserves to continue to regenerate their bodies.  When the energy begins to run out, that's when you begin to see and feel the physical effects of digestion--the skin begins to flake off and dissolve, then the organs and so forth, until the entire body is reduced to a brown mass of lifeless physical goo.  The prey's body is little more than mud at this point.  However, this interaction of energies is what maintains the cycle of life in the universe--each creature replenishes it's physical energies through taking the energies of others.  You may have noticed that your own body is strengthened when you digest prey--this is because you are absorbing the physical energies of your prey, dissolving them and pushing them into your bloodstream."
#CHOICE, "Is that why digestion sometimes feels like your whole body is being dissolved, even though it remains the same?", DISSOLVED
#CHOICE,
#CHOICE, "Can I ask you something else?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, DISSOLVED
#SAY, "Yes.  Your skin is truly being dissolved, and at a very rapid pace, but your energies are restoring it even faster--that is, until you no longer have the energies to do so.  That's what healing potions are for--they are essentially just liquids that your body can restore it's energies with.  As the healing potion enters your body, it gradually uses it to replenish it's power.  If it weren't for your body's natural ability to instantly heal itself, you would be digested within seconds of entering a monster's digestive tract."

#CHOICE,
#CHOICE, "Can I ask you something else?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, MONSTERDIE
#SAY, "They actually do heal the same way, restoring their body when it is damaged.  However, monsters have harshly limited reserves and all creatures--monster and girl alike--are designed to 'self-destruct' when they are no longer able to heal themselves.  Most girl species regenerate energy so fast that nothing short of digestion can actually injure them, so this self destruct almost never occurs.  Most monsters, however, have a slightly different energy metabolism that isn't as good at regenerating energy or preserving them when they run out of energy, so when you have hit them enough times, their energy reserves bottom out and they die."
#CHOICE, "That would explain why they tend to explode.  Can I ask something else?", QUESTIONS
#EXIT, "(Leave)"

#BRANCH, OTHERFACTIONS
#SAY, "We speak with them on occaision, and defend ourselves from them when necessary.  We are allies with the brilliant and clever Sisters of Sorcery, as their magical research meshes well with our own, and we find many common intellectual and political interests.  We have a mutual non-aggression pact with the Breasted Regime, which they have honored.  The Star Matriarchy seemed to be on the verge of invading our territory until the war with the Interstellar Assault Fleet diverted their attention.  I can say that it was fortunate for them.  They, like most factions, underestimate our military capabilities.  As for the IAF itself, we have little contact with them, and care little for their insistance that 'regulations require our intervention on their behalf'."

#SAY, "Ah yes, the Enzyme sisters...put simply, there was a time in the past where both of us shared a world with several other factions.  We preferred to keep to ourselves, expanding when it suited us into surrounding territories and signing pacts with nearby factions.  The Enzyme Sisters apparently did not like our choice of allies, and considered us a threat to their superiority.  Thus, they launched an unprovoked attack on one of our outposts.  Our formidable military forces had long been waiting for such an opportunity to test their powers, and our counterattack was swift and overwhelming.  Soon a third of the Enzyme Sisters' territory was in our hands and their army had already been shattered.  They sued for peace, but I considered it a hollow gesture, and considered it prudent to make a point that we do not enter--or leave--wars lightly.  After three fourths of their land had been conquered by our forces, I agreed to peace.  In ages since, they have forgotten that lesson, and attempt to retaliate for that first war at any opportunity."

The fact that we don't destroy them for openly saying such things about us should amply prove that we are not the mindless devourers they say we are.  We possess military might that far surpasses theirs, but we stay our hand because we do not attack unless we are attacked first.  But once we are committed to a full-scale war, we will not stop simply because our opponents realize they are losing, nor are we obligated to do so.  That is what the Enzyme Sisters fail to understand."

#SAY, Combat is based primarily on your strength and dexterity scores.  The higher your dexterity/ the more likely you are to hit and the less likely you are to be hit/ and the higher your strength/ the more damage you will do aside from your basic weapon damage.  Damage also increases simply based on what level you are.  If you get swallowed by something (A fairly frequent occurrence)/ just wriggle around using the normal movement keys until you either get out or end up utterly digested.  (This is the only way to actually die in the game.  So long as some significant part of your anatomy remains unabsorbed/ you can escape and be healed.)  If you are using a missile weapon/ such as a bow/ left-clicking in the main window will fire it at the spot you click on.  Your strength will not affect missile weapon damage.

#SAY, Every once in a while/ you will get ahold of a Gemstone/ Rune or other nifty item that you can insert into another item.

In order to insert a gem or rune into an item/ double-click on it in the inventory/ then double-click on the item you want to put it in.  You should then get a message in the message window saying that the gem was inserted.  You can insert as many gems as you want into an item/ but there is a limit to how many powers an item can have/ and it's useless to add a power to it that it already has (Magical effects are not cumulative as far as gems are concerned).

The easiest way to activate combat skills is to hit the '+' key on the number pad/ as this will cycle through each combat skill you have available.  (In other words/ hit '+' to change which combat skill you're using)  Most combat skills will only use combat points when they're actually having an effect/ and when you run out of combat points/ the skill will no longer function.

The skills in the leftmost column are 'Class Skills' for your character--they cost half as much to raise as other skills.

You can also use life potions with the '.' key on the number pad.  The amount of life that potions restore is variable--certain quests can give you 'potion enhancements' that cause each potion to restore more life. There are also a few other ways to restore life/ such as regeneration skills and healing fountains that can be found in most towns/ and if you get the skills neccessary to eat monsters/ you regain hit points as you digest them.

After our queen was lost/ she made a prophecy that the prodigy of our queen's final egg--the last egg to hatch--would go forth and slay this dragoness.  There was only one egg left before you emerged from that cave.  Your egg/ my dear/ was the last our queen ever laid.

#CHOICE, Very well.  I shall go forth and slay this Thirsha/ and bring her head back on a wagon!, HOW

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, Because only you hold the potential I see in so few others these days.  In you is the possibility for greatness.  Certainly Allanna's sword is quicker--certainly Yratta's mind is faster.  But I fear they have reached their potential.  They cannot grow beyond their roles--already/ their duties consume them.  But in you I sense a great spark.  Only you may survive the bellies of our monstrous enemies and see us through to victory/ as Atriel prophesied.

#CHOICE, Thanks.  What do you know about Thirsha?,THIRSHA
#EXIT, Thanks.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, THIRSHA
#SAY, I know she has a voracious appetite and many/ many enemies.  She refuses to feed on the other beasts near her lair/ choosing instead to travel to the cities in the region and devour their citizens.  This is the reason why the monsters have become so numerous--the city guard for each town are becoming more and more depleted as Thirsha swoops down from the sky and swallows dozens at a time.

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the mercenaries you sell?, ABOUTMERCS
#CHOICE, What beasts are you referring to?, MONSTERS
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, ADVICE
#SAY, Quite a bit.  I am captain of the guard/ and this has it's perks as far as battlefield experience.  The first thing to keep in mind is to keep your energy up.  Healing potions are the only real way to do this.  Watch your health carefully--if you begin to weaken/ monsters can take advantage of it.  Every monster has one thing on it's mind: Food.  They'd rather eat you than fight you/ and they'll try to swallow you with practically every attack they make.
#CHOICE, Swallow me?, SWALLOW
#CHOICE, Is there any way to keep from being eaten?, KEEPFROM
#CHOICE, What happens if one of them does swallow me?, WHATIF
#EXIT, I'll keep that in mind.  Thanks.

#BRANCH, SWALLOW
#SAY, That's right.  We're all just a bunch of walking picnics to the monsters.  They want their nutrition/ and there's no quicker source of it than us.  They don't seem to care what happens to us once we're in their stomachs.
#CHOICE, You mean they'll swallow me WHOLE?, WHOLE
#CHOICE, Well/ I'd like to have something to say about that., KEEPFROM
#EXIT, Sounds dangerous.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, SWALLOW
#SAY, Oh yes.  You get to feel them digesting you and everything.
#CHOICE, You mean they swallow me WHOLE?, WHOLE
#CHOICE, Is there any way to escape?, WHATIF

#BRANCH, WHOLE
#SAY, You bet.  Monsters can stretch their stomachs quite a bit--more than you would guess from looking at them.  Even small monsters can make enough room for someone your size.  They'll just pin you down and force you down their throats/ right into their stomachs.  Whole/ and alive.  Apparently they enjoy feeling their prey squirm as their stomach absorbs it.
#CHOICE, Sounds horrible. Is there any way to escape if you get swallowed?, WHATIF
#EXIT, I don't think I want to talk about this anymore.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, WHATIF
#SAY, It is possible to escape/ technically.  Most monsters' throat muscles are quite strong/ and most monsters likewise tend to try their best to keep their food in their stomachs.  However/ if you're strong enough/ you can sometimes shove your way back out.  You may as well try.  The only other alternative is to be digested alive.
#CHOICE, Sounds bad.  Is there any way to keep from getting eaten in the first place?, KEEPFROM
#EXIT, Thanks for the info.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, KEEPFROM
#SAY, The best way is to keep your energy up and be quick on your feet.  A high dexterity means you are less likely to be eaten--it also helps to be skilled in dodging your opponent's blows.  They can't eat you if they can't touch you.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,MAIN
#EXIT, Thank you.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, ABOUTMERCS
#SAY, You can purchase mercenaries in any town.  Mercenaries go into your inventory until you decide to use them.  They will fight alongside you/ but just like you/ they can be damaged and even swallowed whole by monsters.  If they are eaten/ you can save them by killing the monster who swallowed them.  Likewise/ in the unfortunate event that you yourself are eaten/ they can save you.  They are thus quite a good investment/ though you do not gain experience from monsters that they kill.
#CHOICE, Thanks. I had another question about the guard...,GUARD
#CHOICE, Thanks. I was wondering about the monsters in this region...,MONSTERS
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, GUARD
#SAY, The guard is the squadron of girls that keeps the monsters out.  I lose a few to the beast's appetites every few days/ but it's necessary to keep the whole town from becoming a banquet.  It's hard to keep recruitment up when the girls keep seeing members of the guard devoured whole/ but I do my best to keep them safe.
#CHOICE, Can I join the guard?, JOIN

#ADDCHOICES, NAME

#BRANCH, MONSTERS
#SAY, This town is practically in the center of everything/ but seems to be in the midst of a calm spot.  To the North is the Plain of Beasts/ which contains dangerous Harpies/ Karis and Duamutef knows what else.  To the south are the marshes and the swamps/ which contain all manner of reptiles/ any of which would love to make a meal out of any of us.  And to the east and west is the Forest of Doubts--less dangerous perhaps than the swamp or the plains/ but don't think they're safe. Far from it.  And practically everywhere around here are the slime vines...They'll wrap around you and secrete acidic goo while they hold you tight/ dissolving you right where you stand.
#CHOICE, Tell me about the monsters in the Forest., FOREST
#CHOICE, Tell me about the reptiles in the Marsh.,MARSH
#CHOICE, Tell me about the beasts in the Plains.,PLAINS
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, FOREST
#SAY,  The forest is mostly home to Karis--giant creatures that are half woman/ half spider.  Their oversized abdomens are designed for only one thing: holding large prey/ say about your size/ inside their body so that they can digest them efficiently.  They're tough monsters/ and take quite a few hits to bring down.  
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had another question about the monsters...,MONSTERS

#BRANCH, MARSH
#SAY, The marsh is full of reptiles.  Snakes/ frogs/ nagas/ you name it; if it slithers/ it's in there.  Besides being slimy/ they all have one other thing in common--they're all hungry/ all the time.  You see a snake opening it's maw/ you get the hell out of the way/ because it's probably aimed at you.  The frogs are almost as bad.  They'll flick their tongue out and yank you right in without so much as a peep/ and few things smell worse than the gunk in a Frog's stomach.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had another question about the monsters...,MONSTERS

#BRANCH, PLAINS
#SAY, The Plain of Beasts is so named because it is/ obviously/ full of beasts.  You'll see karis and slime vines there/ of course/ but what's really scary are the harpies.  Deadly fast/ nigh unhittable/ and with a temper to match.  You'd best watch your step.  Nobody wants to end up a meal for one of those merciless hags.  Not that they plan to give you a choice.

#SAY, Say what? You mean you're going to FIGHT her!?  Look/ I know the fame and glory have got to be great and all/ but let's be realistic here.  If you go up against Thirsha/ you'll go down her throat and out whatever her scaled hide considers to be her ass.
#CHOICE, Well/ somebody's got to do it.  Do you know anything about her?, DEFEAT2
#CHOICE, You're right.  I'm a retard.  I had another question...,MAIN
#EXIT, You obviously don't have any faith in me.  I'm leaving.

#BRANCH, DEFEAT2
#SAY, Oh/ I suppose...I hear she lives in a cave far to the north/ past the deserts and the volcanic region.  I hear the Demonguts and the Firebellies live up near there/ too...as if Thirsha wasn't dangerous enough.  If you're going to fight her/ you'll need to be very powerful.
#CHOICE, Neat.  I had another question...,MAIN

#BRANCH, REGION
#SAY, This city is pretty much in the middle of the Forest of Doubts/ in sort of a thin area.  You could say this city pretty much crosses right through the middle--you can go from the marshes to the desert without even going through the forest if you come through this city.  There's another town called the City of Angels to the west which is friendly to us--unfortunately, that's about all I know.

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Nice to meet you.  Bye.

#BRANCH, CONSORT
#SAY, Yes.  I speak for our town in all of our official contacts with the clans.  It is beneficial to have a diplomat/ as our town is not a member of any clan.  Neutrality has it's benefits/ but only when one can exploit them.  The City of Angels/ to the west/ is also neutral.  You may wish to visit them.
#CHOICE, What is our relationship with the other clans?,RELATE
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Ah/ I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, RELATE
#SAY, Most of the clans are content to ignore us.  They have enough problems of their own--primarily each other.  Nearly every clan has at least one arch-enemy; the Firebellies and the Demonguts/ the Darkswallows and the Whitethroats...Wars are fairly common/ even among non-rivals.  Thankfully/ I have been able to make sure that none of them has any particular reason to attack us.  That doesn't mean they're entirely safe to be around/ however.
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Ah/ I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, CLANS
#SAY, There are five major clans represented in this region.  Clans Demongut/ Darkswallow and Firebelly can be found to the north/ whereas the unusual Clan Gurglemeister is rumored to have a city to the south.  Also/ we have heard tales of a city belonging to the enigmatic Velvet Intestine clan far to the east/ beyond the volcanic pass.
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Demongut., DEMONGUT
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Firebelly., FIREBELLY
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Gurglemeister., GURG
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Darkswallow., DS
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Velvet Intestine., VI
#CHOICE, Sounds fascinating. What can you tell me about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Sounds fascinating. But I have to go.

#BRANCH, VI
#SAY, Clan Velvet Intestine is an enigmatic and mysterious clan/ given over to magic and subtlety. They are slow to anger compared to other clans/ but like most/ one had best not encounter them while they are hungry.  Their lake city is far/ far to the east/ and you must travel through the volcanic pass in the northeast in order to reach it.  They are the only ones who know of the location of the blue Key of Thirsha/ however/ so it is inevitable that you will have to find them.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, DS
#SAY, The most conniving of the clans may well be the black clan Darkswallow.  Of the clans most tended towards diplomacy/ the Darkswallows and the Whitethroats/ the Darkswallows are the only relevant ones to us because there are no known Whitethroats in this region.  Do not let their names fool you; the Whitethroats are no less treacherous/ and the Darkswallows can be cordial enough when it suits them to do so.  They have a city to the northwest/ in the mountainous regions.  Both clans are highly secretive/ and highly wary of one another.  The closest Darkswallow city is Blackscourge, in the mountainous region west of the northern deserts.  It may be useful to visit the city if you're in the area/ provided you watch your step.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, DEMONGUT
#SAY, Clan Demongut is a wanton and chaotic clan.  They care only for their own firey appetites/ owing little to honor or even strategy.  Nonetheless/ they are fierce warriors and intensely dangerous simply because of this ferocity.  The one reliable thing about the Demonguts is their animosity towards the Firebellies; the two have a feud that has stretched back as long as anyone can remember.  The Demonguts have a castle far to the north/ just west of Thirsha's Volcano and north of the Darkswallow city of Blackscourge.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, FIREBELLY
#SAY, Clan Firebelly is cruel and sadistic/ but cunning just the same.  It is possible to deal with them/ but their hunger often overrides any feigned friendship they may have with you.  Always watch the Firebellies--one moment in their lap/ the next in their belly/ so it is said.  They have an intense hatred for the Demonguts--the one time you can be assured of your safety is when they have these much more preferable enemies around.  There is a Firebelly city to the northeast in the volcanic region.  It is called Skinbane.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, GURG
#SAY, The Gurglemeisters are an odd group.  Sociable as a whole/ but still unsettling in their obsession with their own digestive tracts.  You'd best watch your step around them--they may swallow you just as a prank/ but they're not about to burp you back up and risk ruining the joke...We're not sure where the Gurglemeisters live/ that is if they have a city at all/ but several have come from the south.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, THIRSHA
#SAY, I have heard of your quest to defeat Thirsha the dragon.  All my hopes go with you in your travels.  Know this--Thirsha is powerful indeed/ but she knows that there are some who could defeat her/ especially if the clans were to combine to hunt her down. Thus/ she has secured her lair with three magical doors/ each requiring a different key.  These keys have been scattered throughout the land/ requiring that whomever seeks to challenge her seek the keys first.
#CHOICE, And where are these keys?,KEYS

#BRANCH, KEYS
#SAY, The first key is said to be in a cave far to the south.  Last I heard the caves were filled with dangerous worms; giant fanged grubs that will yank a girl right off her feet and chomp her down right there. Sadly/ that may be the easiest key for you to get.  The other keys have found their way into the hands of the clans--the second key is held by Clan Demongut/ and the third is in the hands of Clan Velvet Intestine.  Neither may be willing to give them up for nothing.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,CLANS
#EXIT, Then I suppose I had best seek them out.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, QUEST
#SAY, I have learned of a Naga Queen who lives in the caves far to the south/ past the marshes and the reptile bog. Her serpentine followers have been eating our girls for months.  I have tired of my apprentices ending up as Naga-excrement. I can provide you with an enhancement for your mana potions for your trouble if you can destroy her for me.  Remember/ though/ that you'd have to fight through not only the reptile bog but also the cave itself.  I wouldn't recommend you try it unless you're already a powerful warrior.

#EXIT. Whatever. Goodbye.

#BRANCH, JOIN
#SAY, I would/ but I am forbidden.  A rival sorceress of mine/ a Darkswallow by the name of Rutara/ would instantly set upon me if I were to leave here.  And while I could handle her/  I have my doubts that I could defeat both her and Thirsha simultaneously.
#CHOICE, Whatever. Pansy.,MAD
#CHOICE, That's a pretty lame excuse. Honestly.,MAD
#CHOICE, Makes sense.  Can I ask you about something else?,QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, MAD
#SAY, How dare you speak to me in such a fashion.  I have half a mind to shrink you down and swallow you myself!  See if a few hours wallowing in my vomit would teach you some manners.  If only you weren't Tanna's little pet hero...
#EXIT, Whatever/ bitch.  I'm leaving.
#CHOICE, Look/ I'm sorry.  Can I ask you something?,QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, MAGIC
#SAY, Magic is like any other combat skill. It has it's advantages and it's drawbacks. The advantage of magic is that you can attack beasts from a distance--the disadvantage is that if you don't kill it in the first few shots/ it's almost guaranteed to come after you with it's mouth wide open/ waiting to stuff you down it's throat where your spells won't mean a lot.  Most people cannot summon the concentration to cast spells while they're busy being digested.  There are a few ways to escape from a monster's belly besides squirming your way out--particularly scrolls and mercenaries.

#BRANCH, SCROLLMEAN
#SAY, Well/ I don't think I even need to TELL you the benefits of using a teleportation scroll when you're about to be shoved down a monster's intestines.  Other than that/ only a few spells are directly helpful under such circumstances.  Most attack spells--even spells that flare out/ like Blaze--will appear just outside the monster/ failing to harm it.  We believe this must be some sort of interior defensive mechanism that monsters have to allow them to digest mages safely.  We do tend to wonder why this same mechanism doesn't protect them from external spells/ however...In any case/ superheating a monster you happen to be inside at the time might not be the best idea even if you could...

#CHOICE, Do you know anything about Grey Magic?, GREY
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, WHITE
#SAY, White magic is the magic of healing and strength.  I don't know much about it/ because as a sorcereress I rarely use it.  Most white magic involves regaining hit points/ but many white spells can make your attacks hit harder/ and there are even a few offensive white spells.
#CHOICE, What do you know about Black Magic?,BLACK
#CHOICE, Do you know anything about Grey Magic?, GREY
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, GREY
#SAY, Of course I know about Grey magic.  Grey magic is the magic of enchantment--changing things to suit your will.  Most enchantresses and other practitioners of the Grey arts focus on changing themselves/ making themselves faster/ stronger and smarter than they would be.  Many grey spells can also offer protection or defenses against monsters.  The downfall of Grey magic is that it possesses almost no direct offensive capabilities/ so you had best have another way to destroy your foes or all of your enchantments will be for naught.
#CHOICE, What do you know about Black Magic then?,BLACK
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about White Magic?, WHITE
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, BLACK
#SAY, Black magic is the magic of offense.  It is for those who tire of enigmatic means and decide simply to reduce their enemies to ashes.  Black magic is primarily attack spells/ but the Black school also contains many rituals which boost the caster's intelligence--increasing the potency of any spells cast henceforth.
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about White Magic?, WHITE

#EXIT, Thanks Ralyrra.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, NAME
#SAY, My name is Ralyrra.  I sell clothing of all types/ of the highest quality...or at least/ the highest quality you can find around here.  Truth is/ it's hard to find the higher quality materials--silk/ velvet and so forth--way out here.  I'd certainly make clothes out of them/ if I had them...

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clothing you sell?,ABOUTCLOTHES
#EXIT, Thanks Ralyrra.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, ABOUTCLOTHES
#SAY, Clothing is your best protection against monsters/ short of actual armor.  It reduces the damage you take from beasts attacking you/ and can even absorb some of the acid in the unfortunate circumstance that you are swallowed by one.
#CHOICE, Swallowed!? Eww!!,EWW
#CHOICE, Go on.,MORE
#EXIT, I don't think that'll happen.  Well/ I have to go now.

#BRANCH, MORE
#SAY, This does/ however/ mean that your clothes will eventually be digested by whatever beast has swallowed you.  A partially-digested set of clothing is not only atrocious-smelling/ but itchy and uncomfortable--and worth significantly less as far as stopping enemy attacks.  A shredded/ acid-soaked shirt is little defense against a set of claws.
#CHOICE, Okay/ now you're REALLY grossing me out.,EWW
#CHOICE, I'll keep that in mind.  Can I buy some clothes now?,MAIN
#EXIT, That's nasty. I'm leaving.

#BRANCH,EWW
#SAY, Well/ the digestive process may be gross/ but you're going to get a firsthand lesson in it if you're not careful.  Proper clothing can help prevent you from meeting an untimely end in some beasty's belly.
#CHOICE, Alright.  You've convinced me.  What have you got?,#SELLCLOTHES::Upper:Lower
#EXIT, That doesn't mean you have to talk about it.  I'm leaving.

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the armor you sell?,ABOUTARMOR 
#EXIT, Thanks.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, ABOUTARMOR
#SAY, Armor takes the direct approach in defending you from enemies.  Each piece of armor you wear reduces the damage you take from enemy attacks/ and makes digesting you a painful proposition at best.
#CHOICE, Digesting me?,DIGEST
#CHOICE, What kinds of armor work best?,BEST
#CHOICE, What's the difference between armor and clothing?,DIFF
#CHOICE, Can I buy some armor?,#SELLARMOR:1
#EXIT, That'll be all/ thanks.

#BRANCH, DIGEST
#SAY, Wake up/ girl.  The forest is full of creatures with only one thing on their mind: Food.  And their primary diet is girls just like you.  If you go out and fight them/ sooner or later one of them is going to gobble you up like a piece of lettuce.  And when that happens/ you'll be glad you're wearing plate mail in the meantime/ because it can take a while to force your way back out.  If you can/ that is.
#CHOICE, So is it possible for a monster to digest armor?,DIGARM
#CHOICE, I see.  I had some other questions about armor...
#EXIT, Thank you for the information.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, DIGARM
#SAY, Unfortunately/ yes.  The beasts around here can digest practically *anything*/ but it will usually take a lot longer to digest armor than it would normal clothing.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions about armor...,ABOUTARMOR
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I wanted to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, BEST
#SAY, There are two things that go into armor's effectiveness: It's type and it's material.  Armorsmiths will tell you the armor rating of each piece of armor they show you.  You can use this to make a decision/ but keep in mind that certain items--generally the top-of-the-line pieces that are difficult to make--have a higher price than their armor value would reflect.
#CHOICE, Go on...,BEST2

#BRANCH, BEST2
#SAY, Ultimately/ though/ the effectiveness of the armor you can buy is limited by what it's made of.  Due to this damned monster blockade/ I have been reduced to using hardened leather hides to make my armor.  The City of Angels still has a decent supply of bronze/ however/ so you may be able to get some better armor there...if you can afford it.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions about armor...,ABOUTARMOR
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I wanted to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, DIFF
#SAY, The biggest difference is in the level of protection you can get.  Armor is almost always a better choice/ but is also pretty pricey by comparison.  There's also the question of fashion/ if you're into that kind of thing.  Functionally/ the only limit to armor is it's limited variety/ and it's price.  You can't buy a breastplate for the same ten gold you might by a bra with.  The closest thing is a halter/ but they're both a bra and a breastplate--good defense for a bra/ but you can't wear anything overtop of them.  They are one of the cheapest pieces of armor you can buy/ however...
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions about armor...,ABOUTARMOR
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I wanted to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, KILLEDGIANTESS
#SAY, Excellent!  I shall now increase the power of your life potions/ as promised.
#CHOICE, Thank you., #EFFECT:MAIN2:Lifeplus:1

#BRANCH, QUEST
#SAY, To the northwest is a temple.  It is called the Temple of Yppiz/ and is filled with a depraved cult who are raising a giantess.  They have been feeding themselves to her willingly/ and with each meal she grows larger/ stronger and more bold.  She has even begun venturing out of the temple/ and has eaten many of our guardswomen.  I can enhance your life potions if you are able to destroy her for us.
#CHOICE, How do I reach her?, REACH
#CHOICE, How powerful are these cultists?, CULTISTS
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, REACH
#SAY, It is very closeby.  You will simply have to travel directly west/ into the Mora Plains/ and then head north.
#CHOICE, What do you know about these Mora Plains?, MORA
#CHOICE, How powerful are these cultists?, CULTISTS
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, MORA
#SAY, The Mora Plains are home to a more powerful breed of monster than you might be used to.  Like the Forests/ it is filled with dangerous plant life/ but the lower humidity seems to have made the plants there more aggressive in seeking out living prey.
#CHOICE, How powerful are these cultists?, CULTISTS
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, CULTISTS
#SAY, They are powerful indeed.  So powerful that every time our guards have attempted to deal with them/ they have failed.  And by failed/ I mean been shit out by a cultist after being digested alive.  We have even observed magical acolytes in their cult--the novice ones fling fireballs at trespassers/ and the advanced have learned to vomit their own bile at the enemy--they don't even have to swallow you to start digesting you!  (The way she describes them/ it sounds as though they average about 16th level)
#CHOICE, Sounds dangerous.  How can I reach them?,REACH
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, To the east is the Forest of Doubts/ which you've probably seen.  Directly south of here is the Forest Glade--an area that looks idyllic/ but is probably the most dangerous area directly bordering our city.  It is filled with sprites and other magical creatures--creatures that will enchant you with their beautiful eyes right before they ram you bodily down their throats.  To the west are the Mora Plains--slightly less dangerous/ but only slightly.  They're full of carnivorous plants--giant/ two-jawed monstrousities that will snap shut around a girl and start digesting her then and there.
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this city?, CITY
#EXIT, Thanks.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, CITY
#SAY, This is the City of Angels.  We are a peaceful bunch of women/ and try to stay neutral in all the clan conflicts that go on around here.  Our only serious problem has been the Temple of Yppiz.

#ITEM, I would like to buy some scrolls.,Sellscrolls
#CHOICE, I would like to buy some potions., #SELLPOTIONS
#EXIT, No thanks.

#BRANCH, WHAT
#SAY, Scrolls are items that essentially cast spells for you.  It can be difficult to make your way through the Beast Central Station we call our home without any magical capabilities/ and if you're of a more physical bent/ scrolls allow you to make up for any lack of more exotic skills.  Even if you're already a mage/ scrolls can help in a pinch because they don't require any mana to cast them.
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN

#BRANCH, SCROLLS
#SAY, I sell several attack spells--Blaze/ Lightning Storm and Supernova/ which can all damage a number of monsters near you.  I also sell Teleportation scrolls/ excellent for getting treasure out of those hard-to-reach places.  I sell enhancement scrolls which can make you more powerful/ and I even sell All-Dye scrolls which/ when used/ will change the color of all the clothes you may be wearing.  You'll have to put them back on/ though--a side effect is that your clothes are taken off when the spell is cast.

#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, DO
#SAY, I am the City of Angels' premiere Armorsmith.  I am the only one fully entrusted with our dwindling supply of Iron.
#CHOICE, Why are you the only one?, WHY
#CHOICE, Does that mean you sell iron armor?, BRONZE
#CHOICE, What's the difference between bronze and leather?, DIFF

#BRANCH, BRONZE
#SAY, Yes.  I personally manufacture several different defensive pieces/ all out of iron.  Unlike most armor/ some of mine is magical as well.
#CHOICE, Can I buy some?, BUYARMOR
#CHOICE, What's the difference between bronze and leather?, DIFF

#BRANCH, DIFF
#SAY, Iron is an actual metal/ unlike leather which is essentially just a very hard cloth.  As such/ it is far stronger and more durable.  Unfortunately/ despite the fact that it is practically the lowest rung of armor metals besides bronze/ even it is rare due to the monster blockades/ and so it's also more expensive than leather.
#CHOICE, Can monsters digest iron as easily as they digest leather?, DIGEST
#EXIT, I see.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, DIGEST
#SAY, Not usually/ but that doesn't mean they can't digest it.  It doesn't even mean they can't digest it quickly.  But it will generally take longer for them to digest a bronze or iron piece of armor than a leather one/ and the armor will thus continue to protect you longer.  The smell also doesn't tend to soak into metal as easily/ either...
#CHOICE, Ah.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, I see.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, Because I have greater skill both in forging armor and in how to use it--my knowledge allows me to make my armor more comfortable/ not to mention effective.  Though there are a few other merchants in town selling bronze and even iron armor/ my armor is far superior both in quality and due to it's magical abilities/ so I am given much more to work with.
#CHOICE, What did you mean/ 'how to use it'?, HOW
#CHOICE, I see.  So you sell iron armor?, BRONZE
#CHOICE, Can I buy some armor from you then?, BUYARMOR
#EXIT, I see.  Perhaps I'll come back and test your merchandise sometime.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, HOW
#SAY, There is more to making the most of your armor than simply strapping it to your chest and wading into battle.  A true warrior knows how to move the right way to catch blows on the strongest plates/ and how to evade in such a way that claws and teeth deflect from plates rather than sink in.
#CHOICE:SAYONCE, Can you teach me?, TEACH
#CHOICE, Oh.  I get it.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, I understand.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, TEACH
#SAY, I'd be delighted to.  First/ you must learn when to roll with an attack and when to block it/ and when you should simply get out of the way...
#CHOICE, (MORE), #GIVESKILL:Defence:TEACH2

#BRANCH, TEACH2
#TEXT, You have gained one point in the Defence skill.
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH3

#BRANCH, TEACH3
#SAY, ...So there you have it.  I could probably teach you more/ but I'm not a full-time instructor...those pointers I gave you should be enough.
#CHOICE, Thank you/ Rudiia.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, DEAD
#SAY, Actually/ she's supposedly refined the skill of escaping from monster's bellies to the point that she can wriggle her way out of almost anything.  At least/ she's wriggled her way out of everything so far...granted/ it's just a matter of time before she underestimates how strong some monster's gastrointestinal muscles are and ends up being squirted out the monster's business end as something less than she was...

Some of our mages can actually control the worms/ but unfortunately their sheer numbers has begun to make our control more and more precarious...we already don't control any of the worms in the adjacent caves/ and every once in a while one of the worms will just turn around and gobble one of us right up...

#EXIT, Yeah.  Well/ I gotta go now.

#BRANCH, SURVIVE
#SAY, Well/ the trick is knowing how to get out before they really start to digest you.  You've got to find the right footholds/ the right handholds/ and learn how to move your body properly so you can actually get somewhere without just sliding around in the slippery flesh.  It's an art form that few girls get the opportunity to master.
#CHOICE, I'm...sure it is.  Can we talk about something else?, MAIN

#SAY, The next thing to do is to form a plan of escape.  If your enemy's mouth empties right into it's stomach/ like with a frog or a Kari/ then the most important thing is just to get one or two of your limbs out of it's mouth to find some solid part of the monster's exterior to leverage against.  If your enemy is something with a long throat/ such as a snake or/ say/ me/ your job becomes a bit tougher.
#CHOICE, ALRIGHT!! POINT MADE!! LET ME OUT!!!, TEACH7

#SAY, In cases like that you'll need concentration and a lot of brute strength.

Concentrate on holding your ground when they push you towards the intestines/ and use any opposite movements to drive yourself towards the entrance to the throat or mouth.

#BRANCH, HELP
#SAY, So you want to help us?  Strange.  Though I imagine anyone who has ever met a Demongut would agree that they need to be scourged from the planet entirely.  Alright/ here's what you can do.  The Demonguts have holed up in their castle to the northwest.  We have been unable to attack them directly/ because the Darkswallows claim every path through the area as their own and refuse to allow us passage.  We obviously cannot fight them both/ much as we would like to.  However/ that doesn't mean we can't still strike them a blow.  If you can sneak into their castle and destroy their queen/ you will prove yourself a friend to Clan Firebelly.

There is an old saying that describes most creatures in our world/ and it applies very well to them:  'they're not much more than pretty faces slapped on an elaborate digestive tract.'  Besides them/ there are also fire grubs and nightvines/ both of which are typically voracious but not often as dangerous.  To the southeast is the Volcanic pass/ which leads to the largely unexplored lakeland region.  This pass is guarded by full-fledged demonesses/ and we suspect it may also be part of the reason there are so many succubi in the area.

#SAY,  I've heard you hunt monsters in exchange for potion enhancements.  I have a proposition for you.  To the north is a large cave that has become a de-facto nest for a hive-like variety of Kari species.  These karis have become quite the nuisance.  We have discovered that a particular breed of Kari is laying all the eggs for the hive. They should be easy to recognize/ for they are white in color.  If you can go through the cave and wipe out these white karis/ I can enhance your life potions.
#CHOICE, They're as good as dead.,OKAY
#CHOICE, I'll probably have to go through that area anyway/ so okay.,OKAY
#CHOICE, I'll keep an eye out for them.,OKAY
#CHOICE, I'm not really that much of a bounty hunter/ actually., NO
#CHOICE, Sorry/ you heard wrong.  I'd rather not risk it.,NO

#BRANCH, NO
#SAY, Very well.  But if you change your mind/ simply kill the beasts and return to me.  The reward will still be waiting for you.
#EXIT, (Leave)

#BRANCH, OKAY
#SAY, Excellent.
#CHOICE, In the meantime/ can I ask you some questions?,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, (Leave)

#BRANCH, MAIN2
#SAY, (Illiana nods to you as you approach)  You again.  Was there something you wanted?
#CHOICE:IFQUEST:White Kari, I have destroyed the White Karis for you., #CHANGESTART:MAIN3:QUESTCOMPLETE
#CHOICE, I just had some questions., QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Nope.  Never mind.

#BRANCH, QUESTCOMPLETE
#SAY, Excellent work/ $NAME.  I shall strengthen your life potions--and here is another small token of my appreciation.  (She hands you a large bag of coins)
#EFFECT, Lifeplus:1
#EFFECT, GiveGold:50000
#CHOICE, Thank you.,#TAKEOBJ:MAIN3

#BRANCH, MAIN3
#SAY, (Illiana nods to you as you approach)  What can I do for you/ $NAME?
#CHOICE, I just had some questions., QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Nothing.

#BRANCH, QUESTIONS
#SAY, What exactly did you want to know?
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about your city here?, CITY
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this area?, AREA
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the Darkswallow clan?, CLAN
#CHOICE, What do you think of the other clans?, OTHERCLANS
#EXIT, That's all.  Thank you for your help.

#BRANCH, CITY
#SAY, Blackscourge is little more than an outpost.  The saturation of monsters in this region has prevented us from expanding/ but our guards have been able to keep the beasts out of our town.
#ADDCHOICES, QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, The mountains we have settled in here are treacherous/ to say the least.  Besides the jagged stone and obsidian that you must brave simply to walk around/ it is filled with a huge number of monsters/ just like every other area in this region.  There seems to be a particular concentration of centauresses and harpies around here--doubtless due to their unique ability to traverse the chaotic and rocky terrain.  Both subsist on a steady diet of travellers that try to make their way through the mountains.
#ADDCHOICES, QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, OTHERCLANS
#SAY, They're little better than the beasts/ for the most part.  The Demonguts to the north are practically monsters in their own right--they attack anyone who ventures anywhere near their castle.
#CHOICE, What about the Firebellies/ to the west?, FIREBELLIES
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks.  That's all I needed to know.

#BRANCH, CLAN
#SAY, We are a powerful clan with a rich history.  Our presence in this region is scarce/ limited only to this city.  As powerful as the guards in this town are/ they are only a trifle compared to the true might of Clan Darkswallow.  More cities belonging to our kind can be found far to the northwest/ but you would not be able to reach them due to the mountains.
#CHOICE, What is your relationship with the Firebellies to the east?, FIREBELLIES
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, FIREBELLIES
#SAY, The Firebellies are normally an aggressive and violent clan.  Unfortunately/ our proximity to Castle Demongut makes it most inconvenient to attempt to deal with both.  For that reason/ we have formed a treaty with the Firebellies.  We don't bother them/ they don't bother us.
#CHOICE, Does this treaty prevent the Firebellies from travelling to Castle Demongut?, PREVENT
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, PREVENT
#SAY, Yes.
#CHOICE, But then what's the point?  Why not just let the Firebellies attack the castle and do your fighting for you?, WHY
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, Because the Firebellies are far too aggressive for their own good/ and they refuse to admit that the Demonguts have them outgunned.  At the moment/ only the threat of leaving their castle vulnerable to us prevents the Demonguts from marching their forces into Skinbane.  But if the Firebellies were to attack Castle Demongut themselves/ they'd be wiped out/ allowing the Demonguts to spread through the area at their liesure--and with that much territory/ they would begin to pose a serious threat.  But so long as the treaty holds/ the Firebellies won't attack us and neither will the Demonguts--neither wants to weaken themselves so much fighting us that they would be vulnerable to each other.
#CHOICE, So you're not protecting the Demonguts from the Firebellies...you're protecting the Firebellies from the Demonguts?, PROTECT
#CHOICE, Whoah.  That's kinda clever.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, PROTECT
#SAY, In essence.  We're satisfied so long as the two keep one another in check/ because this way we don't have to deal with *either* of them.
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#CONVERSATION, Vonirea
#BRANCH, MAIN
#SAY, Good evening/ stranger.  Is there something you wanted?
#CHOICE, Yes.  Do you have the third Key of Thirsha?, KEY
#CHOICE, Who are you?, WHO
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this area?, AREA
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, WHO
#SAY, My name is Vonirea of Clan Velvet Intestine.  I am this city's combat instructor.  I teach the city guard how to survive against the beasts in this region.
#CHOICE, How DO you get them to survive against the stuff around here?, SURVIVE
#CHOICE, Do you have the third Key of Thirsha?, KEY
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this area?, AREA
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, SURVIVE
#SAY, It isn't easy/ believe me.  The succubusses alone are practically enough to make a quick brunch out of our entire town.  The best tactic I have discovered so far is to teach each of my disciples how to regrow their skin as quickly as possible/ granting them the survivability they need to come back from their guard shifts.  They still can't quite regain their life as fast as a succubus can digest it/ but it certainly gives them a better chance.
#CHOICE:SAYONCE, You mean you teach regeneration?  Could you teach me?, TEACH
#CHOICE, I see.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, TEACH
#SAY, Theoretically/ but that is a secret of Clan Velvet Intestine.  You'd have to prove yourself a friend of our clan before I could teach you.
#CHOICE, I'm going after Thirsha the Dragon.  I'm sure that would benefit you as much as anyone., TEACH2

#BRANCH, TEACH2
#SAY, You--YOU'RE the one going after Thirsha?  We'd heard about you...I was almost sure you were already dead.  What are you doing in Allia?
#CHOICE, I'm trying to get ahold of the third key to Thirsha's Lair., KEY2
#CHOICE, I'm trying to get more powerful items to fight her with., ITEMS

#BRANCH, KEY2
#SAY, Oh yeah...the one that Matrynia was carrying when she was swallowed.  I don't know how you're going to get that key back/ but if you're going after Thirsha/ you're going to need all the help you can get.  I suppose I could teach you...
#CHOICE, Rock on., TEACH3

#BRANCH, ITEMS
#SAY, Well/ there is a dungeon to the southeast that has some sort of hyper-powerful weapon.  If you're going after it OR Thirsha/ you're going to need all the help you can get.  I suppose I could teach you...
#CHOICE, Rock on., TEACH3

#BRANCH, TEACH3
#SAY, Now/ the first thing is to visualize your skin/ become more aware of it.  Start to get a feel for it/ and the energy in it.  Start to channel this energy/ excite it/ accelerate it/ make your skin leap forth with it's energy and multiply...
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH4

#BRANCH, TEACH4
#TEXT, (Vonirea spends the next little while giving you basics and tips on focusing your body's regenerative abilities.  Your regeneration skill goes up by 1 point.)
#CHOICE, (MORE), #GIVESKILL:Regeneration:TEACH5

#BRANCH, TEACH5
#TEXT, Was there anything else?
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, These are the Lakelands/ and you've probably figured out by now that they are rather dangerous.  This whole continent seems to be infested with a huge number of monsters.  We've learned that there is a dungeon to the far south that is supposed to have some sort of extremely powerful weapon inside/ but every girl who's tried to retrieve it has/ well/ frankly met with less success and more stomach than we would have liked.
#CHOICE, What is this weapon?, WHATWEP
#CHOICE, Ah.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, WHATWEP
#SAY, I am not entirely sure.  We know only that it is supposedly a potent weapon.  Did you want to know anything else?
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN

#BRANCH, MAIN2
#SAY, Yes?
#CHOICE, Do you have the third Key of Thirsha?, KEY
#CHOICE, Who are you?, WHO
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this area?, AREA
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, KEY
#SAY, Unfortunately/ no.  That key used to be in the hands of our clan/ but it was lost some time ago.
#CHOICE, Lost?, LOST
#CHOICE, Do you know where I can find it?, FIND
#CHOICE, Crud.  Can I ask something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, LOST
#SAY, Yes.  It was carried by a woman named Matrynia/ but she fell prey to a groundmaw.  Doubtless she lost her life stewing in it's churning depths.
#CHOICE, Is there any way I can get the key back?, FIND

#BRANCH, FIND
#SAY, Not unless you particularly fancy the idea of diving into a groundmaw and being digested whole.
#CHOICE, Ack.  Never mind.  Can I ask something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, I just might have to.  Goodbye/ then...


#CONVERSATION, Lialyta

#BRANCH, MAIN
#SAY, Hello.  My name is Lialyta.  And you are?
#CHOICE, My name is $NAME., #CHANGESTART:MAIN2:NAME
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, MAIN2
#SAY, (Lialyta nods) Was there something else you needed?
#CHOICE, Have you heard of Thirsha's Keys?, KEYS
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this city?, CITY
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this area?, AREA
#CHOICE, Can you tell me about your clan?, CLAN
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, CLAN
#SAY, We are the Velvet Intestines/ greatest and wisest among the clans.  Just out of curiousity/ which clan do you belong to?  You certainly don't sound like a Firebelly...
#CHOICE, I'm neutral/ actually.  My town didn't belong to any clan., NEUTRAL

#BRANCH, NEUTRAL
#SAY, Ah/ good.  Just stay that way and you'll stay out of trouble.  In any case/ back to your question.  We Velvet Intestines are not as belligerent or wanton as the other clans.  We find the tendency of other clans to constantly try to swallow their enemies whole to be a little childish.
#CHOICE, So you don't swallow girls?, DONT
#CHOICE, Amen.  I had another question...,MAIN2

#BRANCH, DONT
#SAY, Well...I didn't say that.  But I don't think you're in any danger here.
#CHOICE, So you DO swallow girls/ then., DOSWALLOW
#CHOICE, That's good...Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, DOSWALLOW
#SAY, We are flesh and blood/ just as you are.  However/ we find swallowing people kicking and screaming to be savage and uncouth.  Our magical abilities allow us to make our targets a little more...cooperative.
#CHOICE, Cooperative?  You mean they just LET you swallow them?, BRAINWASH
#CHOICE, You mean you brainwash them into WANTING to be swallowed?!, BRAINWASH
#CHOICE, I see.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#CHOICE, Ack.  Never mind then., MAIN2

#BRANCH, BRAINWASH
#SAY, Make no mistake.  We are a civilized clan/ but we have ways to defend ourselves.
#CHOICE, Well/ at least they go willingly...Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#CHOICE, And satisfy your appetites without a fuss/ apparently...,FUSS
#EXIT, Ah.  I think I know all I need to.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, FUSS
#SAY, What do you mean?
#CHOICE, I mean/ it's a convenient way to eat whomever you want/ whenever you want/ without a fight.  Seems like it would be tempting to abuse., ABUSE
#CHOICE, I mean I doubt you only use it on people who attack you., ABUSE
#CHOICE, Never mind...can I ask you about something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, ABUSE
#SAY, You sound as though you're accusing me of something.
#CHOICE, I am.  I think this whole civility thing is just a facade.  You lure people into your city and then you eat them., ACCUSE
#CHOICE, No/ no...never mind.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2

#BRANCH, ACCUSE
#SAY, Sad it is that the touted hero would be so cruel.  But if we were as you say/ I would have eaten you already.
#CHOICE, Bah.  The only reason you haven't is you know you'd be swimming in my stomach if you tried., SWIMMING
#CHOICE, I suppose.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, Never mind then.

#BRANCH, SWIMMING
#SAY, (Her eyes narrow) You are no hero.  You are simply vermin in girl's clothing.  My patience has run out.
#CHOICE, (Attack her), ATTACK
#CHOICE, Wait/ wait..., WAIT
#CHOICE, Okay/ look/ I'm sorry...,WAIT

#BRANCH, ATTACK
#TEXT, She apparently didn't expect such a quick response from you.  You quickly grab her head and practically ram it into your mouth/ stretching your throat wide and swallowing hard.  You manage to get everything up to her shoulders down your throat/.  Though she is fairly strong/ it doesn't take long for you to overpower her/ and soon she is squirming futilely inside your belly.)
#CHOICE, (EXIT), #EATME

#BRANCH, WAIT
#SAY, You are too late.  I shall now prove our powers to you.
#CHOICE, (Attack her), ATTACK
#CHOICE, (Run), RUN

#BRANCH, RUN
#TEXT, You turn around and run away from Lialyta's angry face.  You do not hear her following you.  However/ after a few seconds/ you find yourself with a strange urge.  A VERY strange urge.
#CHOICE, (Walk back to Lialyta), WALK
#CHOICE, (Fight it), WALK

#BRANCH, WALK
#SAY, (You return to Lialyta/ who is smiling wolfishly at you.)  I may not have mentioned/ I'm one of the most powerful sorceresses in our village.  Now do you have anything you would like to say to me?
#CHOICE, I would like you to eat me/ Lialyta., EAT
#CHOICE, Yes.  Please swallow me., EAT
#CHOICE, Yes.  I am very sorry I offended you and would like to make it up to you by jumping down your throat so you can digest me alive., EAT

#BRANCH, EAT
#SAY, Really?  Are you sure?  You really want me to swallow you down/ and digest you alive and whole inside my stomach?
#CHOICE, Yes., EAT2
#CHOICE, Yes please., EAT2
#CHOICE, I sure do., EAT2
#CHOICE, (Shove yourself down her throat), EAT3

#BRANCH, EAT2
#SAY, (She smiles broadly) Well/ okay/ if it's what YOU want...
#CHOICE, (Let her eat you), EAT3

#BRANCH, EAT3
#TEXT, She opens her mouth impossibly wide and bends down slightly/ bringing her throat to about shoulder level on you.  You enthusiastically put your hands together and start shoving them down her throat.  You feel the slick warmth of her esophagus on the sides of your arms as you push them deeper and deeper inside.  You take a step forward and place your head in her mouth/ then take another step that starts to push your face down her gullet.  She helpfully grabs your hips and turns you upside down at this point/ making your descent down her throat much easier.  You simply straighten your body and allow your weight to propel you down her throat.  You slide quickly through the slippery tube and into her liquid-filled stomach.
#CHOICE, (MORE), #DIGESTTO:EAT4:6

#BRANCH, EAT4
#TEXT, You curl up inside her hot digestive liquids/ grateful you can hold your breath as you feel the stomach walls begin to grind against your submerged body.  The euphoria continues as Lialyta's stomach sets about the task of thoroughly digesting it's huge meal.
#EXIT, (EXIT)

#BRANCH, CITY
#SAY, This is the city of Allia/ regional home of the Velvet Intestine clan.  It is a colony from our holdings across the sea.
#CHOICE, Sea?  What sea would that be?, SEA
#CHOICE, Colony?, COLONY

#BRANCH, COLONY
#SAY, Yes.  This is hardly our clan's only city.  However/ the next closest holdings of ours are on islands to the southeast.
#CHOICE, Is there a way to reach these islands?, ISLANDS
#CHOICE, Ah.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, SEA
#SAY, Yes.  The surrounding lakelands are actually freshwater rivers that flow into the sea.
#CHOICE, Really? Is there any way to cross this sea?, ISLANDS

#BRANCH, ISLANDS
#SAY, Not in this game.
#CHOICE, Uh...okay...,MAIN2

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, We are situated just outside the edge of the Jungle of Pain.  The jungle is so named because it is infested with powerful beasts/ and practically every plant in the jungle has a digestive tract just about the right size for one of us.  Surrounding this area are the lakelands/ likewise filled with monsters/ as all of this region seems to be...
#CHOICE, You can thank Thirsha for that.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, Thanks.  That's all I needed to know.

#BRANCH, KEYS
#SAY, Yes/ actually...one of the keys was in our possession until a short time ago.
#CHOICE, Was?, WAS
#CHOICE, You mean it isn't now..., WAS
#CHOICE, Why does that not surprise me?, WAS

#BRANCH, WAS
#SAY, Unfortunately/ the key was carried by a girl named Matrynia.  She was with a party of village guard a few weeks ago when they were set upon by a swarm of unusually large harpies.  Only two of them made it back--the rest apparently became warm meals for their attackers.  One of them said she saw Matrynia fall into the great Groundmaw.
#CHOICE, Groundmaw?, GROUNDMAW
#CHOICE, Does that mean she's dead?, DEAD
#CHOICE, Is there any way to get the key back?, KEY

#BRANCH, GROUNDMAW
#SAY, Yes.  Groundmaws are essentially just giant stomachs buried in the ground.  They rely on unwary travellers simply falling into them/ though I've been told some of them hide themselves or have tentacles that they use to drag their prey into their bodies.  Truth be told/ nobody around here knows much about them/ because they're very rare in this region.  The only one we know of is in the Jungle of Pain to the east--but it's said to be one of the biggest in existance.  It's mouth isn't that big/ but once you get inside/ it's tremendous.  Enough to fit an army.  I don't know how they found that out/ but it means it might be possible to actually find an exit/ assuming you survive long enough...
#CHOICE, So Matrynia could still be alive?, DEAD
#CHOICE, Then how can I get the key?, KEY

#BRANCH, DEAD
#SAY, Well/ if Matrynia were still alive/ she would have made her way back here.  Though there may be a way to escape the Groundmaw/ it can't be easy.  I imagine there's a virtual sea of digestive juices inside.  To be honest/ I'm almost certain she's little more than a puddle of goop somewhere in the groundmaw's cavernous insides by now.
#CHOICE, Then how do we get her key back?, KEY

#BRANCH, KEY
#SAY, If Matrynia was indeed digested inside the groundmaw/ the key is all but lost.
#CHOICE, Could somebody go inside and get it?, GETIT
#CHOICE, Would the key have been digested too?, KEYDIGESTED
#EXIT, Well/ that would seem to fuck my quest.  Goodbye then...

#BRANCH, KEYDIGESTED
#SAY, Possibly.  Virtually nothing is indigestible to the monsters around here.  Even the strongest armor has been known to dissolve if it's in the digestive tract for long enough.
#CHOICE, Then what can I do?, DO

#BRANCH, DO
#SAY, I'd say all you can do is hope that the key WASN'T digested.
#CHOICE, Well/ even if it wasn't/ it's still inside that groundmaw!  How do I get it?, HOW
#EXIT, I suppose.  I'll go investigate further.

#BRANCH, HOW
#SAY, I'd say you don't/ unless you want to actually jump down the Groundmaw's throat and go after it.
#CHOICE, Is that possible?, GETIT
#CHOICE, I just might have to do that/ actually., GETIT

#BRANCH, GETIT
#SAY, Only if you're suicidal.  You'd have to be crazy to go in there.  No girls have come out of it for as long as I've been alive.  And that isn't to say there haven't been several dozen who have fallen in.  With as huge as that thing's insides supposedly are/ the key could be at the bottom of a hundred-foot-deep pool of gastric acid.
#CHOICE, But it might NOT/ and I really need that key., ANYWAY
#CHOICE, Er...do you know where I might get some scuba gear/ then?, SCUBA

#BRANCH, SCUBA
#SAY, Sorry.  Even if you could find scuba gear on this planet/ it could probably digest it anyway.
#CHOICE, Crapola.  But I need to go in there.  I NEED that key., ANYWAY

#BRANCH, ANYWAY
#SAY, Well/ I suppose if you're after Thirsha/ you would...Well/ good luck.
#CHOICE, So where is this Groundmaw?, WHERE
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, Thank you.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, WHERE
#SAY, It's right in the center of the Jungle of Pain to the east.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2

Doubtless most of it came from what Thirsha's meals were carrying when she swallowed them.  This could easily be enough to make your city the most powerful in the region--that is/ if you decide not to just spend it on yourself.  But you'll have plenty of time to make that decision--after all/ as the owner of Thirsha's Keys/ you could leave it here for as long as you wanted and no one would be any the wiser.

#BRANCH, NAGA
#SAY, Oh my/ YES! They squirm all the way down/ but can't kick. I look forward to guard duty and hope they do try to sneak in. Then I can get a tasty snake-girl snack!
#CHOICE, Have the Nagas ever succeeded in eating any of you?, EATEN

#BRANCH, EATEN
#SAY, Once in a while. It makes a great show/ though. One time my friend Jill and I were on guard duty when a Naga snuck up behind us. That snake-slut grabbed Jill's feet and slurped her down. When she had completely enveloped Jill/ I grabbed her tail and sucked it up like spaghetti. She was too stuffed to put up a fight. I could feel her moving around for hours until she just curled up into a ball and digested quietly. Serves that bitch right. I had always wanted to eat Jill.
#CHOICE, Well I hope that meal was worth it!, MAIN
