Beta 1.3 of the RPG is now available.  I have also put a feature lock in place, so now only play balance and bugs will be dealt with.  (Meaning no more characters lost to the incompatibility demons.  Unless there's another bug in the character file stuff...)
You can take a gander at the tremendous list of changes, and download the update (It's frickin' huge) here.
