Special thanks to all those people, who's names I can no longer remember.)  Any praise, bugs, suggestions, money, or unfocused teen angst should be directed to Duam9@hotmail.com.  Enjoy.  (P.S.

SAY, VRPG is played primarily using the number pad.  Make sure Num Lock is turned on (The Num Lock key turns it on and off) and simply hit the number pad keys to move.  You attack the same way--if there is a monster standing in the direction you indicate/ your character will attack it automatically.  Your character will attack once each time you press against a monster, so to keep attacking, keep pressing in that direction.  The same goes for items and NPCs--to talk to an NPC/ simply press in the direction they're standing/ and to pick up an item/ simply walk over it.

#SAY, "Some spells are capable of enchanting items.  To use these spells, select them in the spell window and hit the 'cast' button.  You will be prompted to select a target.  You can then double-click on an item in your inventory to enchant it.  Be aware that if you cast an enchantment spell on an invalid target (Casting a weapon enchantment on a piece of armor, for example) the enchantment is wasted."

#BRANCH, CP
#SAY, "By clicking on your character's stats, you are taken to the character screen.  In this screen, you can change your character's body type by clicking on her, or change her hair color or style by clicking on the buttons to the left of the character portrait.  You also gain 1 character point each time you gain a level, which can be spent on this screen.  You can use them to increase your stats, or to give yourself extra HP, MP, or combat skill points."
#ADDCHOICES, MORE2


#BRANCH, WEAPONS
#SAY, "There are several different weapon classes in the game.  These are Mace, Axe, Staff, Fast (daggers and knives, usually), Sword, Spear, and Bow.  Each weapon class has a special ability.  Maces have a chance to stun any opponent hit (And this is cumulative with the Stun ability).  Axes gain an increase in damage equal to 5% per point of strength your character has, and spears gain the same multiplier from dexterity instead.  Fast weapons grant an extra attack (Similar to the frenzy ability).  Swords use 20% less fatigue than normal, and staffs have a 25% chance of blocking any incoming attack but have very low basic damage.  Bows have a ranged attack (obviously) and gain damage from dexterity rather than strength.  Thus, high dex characters favor spears and bows, and magic users benefit from the special abilities of maces and staffs.  Balanced characters benefit from swords and fast weapons."
#ADDCHOICES, MORE2


#BRANCH, MISC
#SAY, "You can resize the game window and the graphics will automatically size themselves to fit, so you can play the game full-screen.  You can change the gameplay keys and gameplay speed via the File menu.  If you rest by standing still, your mana and endurance will begin to replenish faster."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, DIFF
#SAY, "First of all, being swallowed is a bit different than it was before (See 'Being Eaten').  The game also uses a fatigue system (See 'Fatigue').  Potions no longer heal instantly and are automatically made more effective (and expensive) as you gain levels, but potion boosts still make them more powerful.  Many aspects of the combat system have changed, but you still fight the same way in general.  Important items, such as quest characters, items and monsters, are now marked as X's on the minimap (Oh yeah, there's a minimap now), and cannot be accidentally (or intentionally) eaten.  Each town also has a portal gem that you can use to return to the town simply by using it from your inventory.  Different weapon classes have different advantages, and you can change your character's appearance and choose which stats raise when you gain levels.  Characters now only have access to certain secondary skills, depending on their class."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, EATEN
#SAY, "Sometimes, a monster will grab you and attempt to swallow you.  When this happens, you will be yanked very close to the monster, which will generally have it's mouth open in anticipation of shoving you inside.  You can struggle against them using the movement keys, and if your strength is high enough, you will escape from them.  If not, they will swallow you.  When swallowed, there is still some hope that you can claw your way back out of their throat, but if you don't it's only a matter of time before you reach their stomach.  When this happens, escape becomes all but impossible (it requires an exceptionally high strength and squirm skill), and they will begin to digest you.  At this point, you can either continue to struggle, or hope you survive until they shit you out a little while later.  (They cannot hold you in their stomachs forever.)  Monsters are more likely to eat you if your HP or fatigue are low."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, FATIGUE
#SAY, "The yellow bar below your mana and life bars (In the bottom center of the screen) is your stamina or 'fatigue' bar.  Your character becomes tired during combat, and when she runs low on stamina, her strength and dexterity scores will drop.  Fatigue use is based on how much weight your character has equipped and how strong she is.  Wearing heavy armor and wielding heavy weapons costs much more fatigue for a weak character than it does for a strong character.  Generally, you shouldn't equip weapons that weigh much more than your strength score, and you should keep your total weight as close to your strength as possible.  Basic stamina use is based on your weapon's weight, so this makes the biggest difference.  Being overweighted can also reduce your dexterity regardless of your fatigue.  Your Endurance stat determines how quickly you regain lost fatigue, and how much total fatigue you have."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, COMBAT
#SAY, "Combat is based primarily on your strength and dexterity scores.  The higher your dexterity, the more likely you are to hit and the less likely you are to be hit. The higher your strength, the more damage you will do aside from your basic weapon damage, and the heavier of weapons and armor you can equip.  Damage also increases simply based on what level you are.  If you get swallowed by something (A fairly frequent occurrence), just wriggle around using the normal movement keys until you either get out or end up utterly digested.  (This is the only way to actually die in the game.  So long as some significant part of your anatomy remains unabsorbed, you can escape and be healed.)  If you are using a missile weapon, such as a bow, left-clicking in the main window will fire it at the spot you click on.  Your strength will not affect missile weapon damage, but your dexterity and level will."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, MAGICITEMS
#SAY, "Certain items have magical bonuses associated with them, such as attribute bonuses, skill bonuses, extra hit points and so forth.  These items generally give you their bonuses so long as they are being used--for example, if you're wearing a piece of magical clothing, you will gain all the bonuses it has so long as you're still wearing it.  Such bonuses are listed when you examine the item by clicking on it in your inventory."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, GEMS
#SAY, "Every once in a while, you will get ahold of a Gemstone, Rune or other nifty item that you can insert into another item.  Generally, you will insert these into weapons, armor or clothing, and once done, the item will give you the bonuses listed on the gem.  In order to insert a gem or rune into an item, double-click on it in the inventory, then double-click on the item you want to put it in.  You should then get a message in the message window saying that the gem was inserted.  You can insert as many gems as you want into an item, but there is a limit to how many powers an item can have, and it's useless to add a power to it that it already has (Magical effects are not cumulative as far as gems are concerned).  The game will not tell you when an item has too many powers, so be prudent when adding gems to things, particularly items that already have magical effects.  (Generally, you shouldn't add gems to an item that already has four or more effects, or add a gem with an effect the item already has)"
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, COMBATSKILLS
#SAY, "Combat skills are bought in the Skills window, just like normal skills.  Once you have at least one level in them/ you can activate them and use them as you fight.  You can only have one combat skill active at a time, and they each drain Combat Points to varying degrees.  The easiest way to activate combat skills is to hit the '+' key on the number pad, as this will cycle through each combat skill you have available.  (In other words/ hit '+' to change which combat skill you're using)  Most combat skills will only use combat points when they're actually having an effect, and when you run out of combat points, the skill will no longer function."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, PASSIVESKILLS
#SAY, In the lower right side of the screen is a button labelled 'Skills'.  This is where you can view your current skill levels/ and purchase new ones.  Each skill displays it's description and effect when you move the mouse over it/ and clicking on a particular skill raises it by one point--assuming you have the skill points neccessary to purchase it.  The skills in the leftmost column are 'Class Skills' for your character--they cost half as much to raise as other skills.  The combat skills are also listed in this window/ and they are purchased with combat skill points rather than skill points.  You gain more of both as you gain levels.
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, POTIONS
#SAY, Potions are quite easy to use.  The '1' key (The one that isn't on the number pad) uses life potions and the '2' key uses mana potions.  You can also use life potions with the '.' key on the number pad.  The amount of life that potions restore is variable and depends on your level, and certain quests can give you 'potion enhancements' that cause each potion to restore more life. There are also a few other ways to restore life/ such as regeneration skills and healing fountains that can be found in most towns/ and if you get the skills neccessary to eat monsters/ you regain hit points as you digest them.
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, MAGIC
#SAY, If you have learned any spells/ they will appear on the left side of the screen just above your inventory.  To cast a spell/ select it in the list/ then either right-click on your target in the main window or hit the 'Cast Spell' button.  If you hit 'Cast Spell' or are using a Spell scroll/ you may be prompted to pick your target/ in which case you left-click in the main window on the spot you want to cast the spell on.

#SAY, "If you have learned any spells, they will appear on the left side of the screen just above your inventory.

If you hit 'Cast' or are using a Spell scroll, you may be prompted to pick your target, in which case you left-click in the main window on the spot you want to cast the spell on.  You learn spells by purchasing spell skills in the skills window.  For example, every time you purchase a point in 'Fire Magic', you learn new fire spells, and/or your existing fire spells become more powerful.  If a spell's mana cost is listed as 'PERM', that means it temporarily takes away from your maximum mana which will be restored the next time you gain a level."

#BRANCH, BASIC
#SAY, "VRPG is played primarily using the number pad.  Make sure Num Lock is turned on (The Num Lock key turns it on and off) and simply hit the number pad keys to move.  You attack the same way--if there is a monster standing in the direction you indicate/ your character will attack it automatically.  The same goes for items and NPCs--to talk to an NPC/ simply press in the direction they're standing/ and to pick up an item/ simply walk over it.  You can redefine the keys for movement and such by selecting 'Reassign Keys' in the file menu."
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, INV
#SAY, On the left side of your screen is your inventory.  Simply double-clicking on an item uses it.  Single-clicking causes it's statistics to be listed in the message window.  Selecting an item in the list and hitting "Sell Item" immediately sells it for half of it's listed gold value, and hitting "Drop Item" simply drops it whereever you're currently standing.  Items will remain on the map/ so you can come back and retrieve them at a later time.

It was by a giant dragoness/ with ebony black skin and scales like thorns/ who rampaged through our city and ate dozens of girls--including our queen.  We also had a priestess/ a woman by the name of Atriel.  After our queen was lost/ she made a prophecy that the prodigy of our queen's final egg--the last egg to hatch--would go forth and slay this dragoness.

Healing potions are the only real way to do this.  Watch your health carefully--if you begin to weaken/ monsters can take advantage of it.  Every monster has one thing on it's mind: Food.  They'd rather eat you than fight you/ and they'll try to swallow you with practically every attack they make.
#CHOICE, Swallow me?, SWALLOW
#CHOICE, Is there any way to keep from being eaten?, KEEPFROM
#CHOICE, What happens if one of them does swallow me?, WHATIF
#EXIT, I'll keep that in mind.  Thanks.

#BRANCH, SWALLOW
#SAY, That's right.  We're all just a bunch of walking picnics to the monsters.  They want their nutrition/ and there's no quicker source of it than us.  They don't seem to care what happens to us once we're in their stomachs.
#CHOICE, You mean they'll swallow me WHOLE?, WHOLE
#CHOICE, Well/ I'd like to have something to say about that., KEEPFROM
#EXIT, Sounds dangerous.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, SWALLOW
#SAY, Oh yes.  You get to feel them digesting you and everything.
#CHOICE, You mean they swallow me WHOLE?, WHOLE
#CHOICE, Is there any way to escape?, WHATIF

#BRANCH, WHOLE
#SAY, You bet.  Monsters can stretch their stomachs quite a bit--more than you would guess from looking at them.  Even small monsters can make enough room for someone your size.  They'll just pin you down and force you down their throats/ right into their stomachs.  Whole/ and alive.  Apparently they enjoy feeling their prey squirm as their stomach absorbs it.
#CHOICE, Sounds horrible. Is there any way to escape if you get swallowed?, WHATIF
#EXIT, I don't think I want to talk about this anymore.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, WHATIF
#SAY, It is possible to escape/ technically.  Most monsters' throat muscles are quite strong/ and most monsters likewise tend to try their best to keep their food in their stomachs.  However/ if you're strong enough/ you can sometimes shove your way back out.  You may as well try.  The only other alternative is to be digested alive.
#CHOICE, Sounds bad.  Is there any way to keep from getting eaten in the first place?, KEEPFROM
#EXIT, Thanks for the info.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, KEEPFROM
#SAY, The best way is to keep your energy up and be quick on your feet.  A high dexterity means you are less likely to be eaten--it also helps to be skilled in dodging your opponent's blows.  They can't eat you if they can't touch you.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions..., MAIN
#EXIT, Thank you.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, ABOUTMERCS
#SAY, You can purchase mercenaries in any town.  Mercenaries go into your inventory until you decide to use them.  They will fight alongside you/ but just like you/ they can be damaged and even swallowed whole by monsters.  If they are eaten/ you can save them by killing the monster who swallowed them.  Likewise/ in the unfortunate event that you yourself are eaten/ they can save you.  They are thus quite a good investment/ though you do not gain experience from monsters that they kill.
#CHOICE, Thanks. I had another question about the guard..., GUARD
#CHOICE, Thanks. I was wondering about the monsters in this region..., MONSTERS
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, GUARD
#SAY, The guard is the squadron of girls that keeps the monsters out.  I lose a few to the beast's appetites every few days/ but it's necessary to keep the whole town from becoming a banquet.  It's hard to keep recruitment up when the girls keep seeing members of the guard devoured whole/ but I do my best to keep them safe.
#CHOICE, Can I join the guard?, JOIN
#ADDCHOICES, NAME
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, JOIN
#SAY, I've heard you're going after Thirsha the Dragon.  I think that's dangerous enough.
#ADDCHOICES, NAME

#BRANCH, MONSTERS
#SAY, This town is practically in the center of everything/ but seems to be in the midst of a calm spot.  To the North is the Plain of Beasts/ which contains dangerous Harpies/ Karis and Duamutef knows what else.  To the south are the marshes and the swamps/ which contain all manner of reptiles/ any of which would love to make a meal out of any of us.  And to the east and west is the Forest of Doubts--less dangerous perhaps than the swamp or the plains/ but don't think they're safe. Far from it.  And practically everywhere around here are the slime vines...They'll wrap around you and secrete acidic goo while they hold you tight/ dissolving you right where you stand.
#CHOICE, Tell me about the monsters in the Forest., FOREST
#CHOICE, Tell me about the reptiles in the Marsh., MARSH
#CHOICE, Tell me about the beasts in the Plains., PLAINS
#EXIT, Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

#BRANCH, FOREST
#SAY,  The forest is mostly home to Karis--giant creatures that are half woman/ half spider.  Their oversized abdomens are designed for only one thing: holding large prey/ say about your size/ inside their body so that they can digest them efficiently.  They're tough monsters/ and take quite a few hits to bring down.  
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had another question about the monsters..., MONSTERS

#BRANCH, MARSH
#SAY, The marsh is full of reptiles.  Snakes/ frogs/ nagas/ you name it; if it slithers/ it's in there.  Besides being slimy/ they all have one other thing in common--they're all hungry/ all the time.  You see a snake opening it's maw/ you get the hell out of the way/ because it's probably aimed at you.  The frogs are almost as bad.  They'll flick their tongue out and yank you right in without so much as a peep/ and few things smell worse than the gunk in a Frog's stomach.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had another question about the monsters..., MONSTERS

#BRANCH, PLAINS
#SAY, The Plain of Beasts is so named because it is/ obviously/ full of beasts.  You'll see karis and slime vines there/ of course/ but what's really scary are the harpies.  Deadly fast/ nigh unhittable/ and with a temper to match.  You'd best watch your step.  Nobody wants to end up a meal for one of those merciless hags.  Not that they plan to give you a choice.

#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, WHO
#SAY, I'm Myida.  I live here in town.
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN

#BRANCH, THIRSHA
#SAY, The Dragon Queen?  She's a horrible thing/ all teeth and scales and stomach/ each one waiting to slice you to shreds!  Be wary/ because rumor has it she eats an average of a dozen girls a day/ and it's only a matter of time before her appetite sends her down here!
#CHOICE, Do you know anything that might help me defeat her?, DEFEAT
#CHOICE, Thanks.  What do you know about this area?,REGION
#EXIT, Thanks.  Bye bye then.

#BRANCH, DEFEAT
#SAY, Say what? You mean you're going to FIGHT her!?  Look/ I know the fame and glory have got to be great and all/ but let's be realistic here.  If you go up against Thirsha/ you'll go down her throat and out whatever her scaled hide considers to be her ass.
#CHOICE, Well/ somebody's got to do it.  Do you know anything about her?, DEFEAT2
#CHOICE, You're right.  I'm a retard.  I had another question...,MAIN
#EXIT, You obviously don't have any faith in me.  I'm leaving.

#BRANCH, DEFEAT2
#SAY, Oh/ I suppose...I hear she lives in a cave far to the north/ past the deserts and the volcanic region.  I hear the Demonguts and the Firebellies live up near there/ too...as if Thirsha wasn't dangerous enough.  If you're going to fight her/ you'll need to be very powerful.
#CHOICE, Neat.  I had another question...,MAIN

#BRANCH, REGION
#SAY, This city is pretty much in the middle of the Forest of Doubts/ in sort of a thin area.  You could say this city pretty much crosses right through the middle--you can go from the marshes to the desert without even going through the forest if you come through this city.  There's another town called the City of Angels to the west which is friendly to us--unfortunately, that's about all I know.
#CHOICE, Thanks. I had another question...,MAIN

#CHOICE, Clan consort?,CONSORT
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Nice to meet you.  Bye.

#BRANCH, CONSORT
#SAY, Yes.  I speak for our town in all of our official contacts with the clans.  It is beneficial to have a diplomat/ as our town is not a member of any clan.  Neutrality has it's benefits/ but only when one can exploit them.  The City of Angels/ to the west/ is also neutral.  You may wish to visit them.
#CHOICE, What is our relationship with the other clans?,RELATE
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Ah/ I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, RELATE
#SAY, Most of the clans are content to ignore us.  They have enough problems of their own--primarily each other.  Nearly every clan has at least one arch-enemy; the Firebellies and the Demonguts/ the Darkswallows and the Whitethroats...Wars are fairly common/ even among non-rivals.  Thankfully/ I have been able to make sure that none of them has any particular reason to attack us.  That doesn't mean they're entirely safe to be around/ however.
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the clans?, CLANS
#CHOICE, What do you know about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Ah/ I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, CLANS
#SAY, There are five major clans represented in this region.  Clans Demongut/ Darkswallow and Firebelly can be found to the north/ whereas the unusual Clan Gurglemeister is rumored to have a city to the south.  Also/ we have heard tales of a city belonging to the enigmatic Velvet Intestine clan far to the east/ beyond the volcanic pass.
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Demongut., DEMONGUT
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Firebelly., FIREBELLY
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Gurglemeister., GURG
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Darkswallow., DS
#CHOICE, Tell me about Clan Velvet Intestine., VI
#CHOICE, Sounds fascinating. What can you tell me about Thirsha the Dragon?, THIRSHA
#EXIT, Sounds fascinating. But I have to go.

#BRANCH, VI
#SAY, Clan Velvet Intestine is an enigmatic and mysterious clan/ given over to magic and subtlety. They are slow to anger compared to other clans/ but like most/ one had best not encounter them while they are hungry.  Their lake city is far/ far to the east/ and you must travel through the volcanic pass in the northeast in order to reach it.  They are the only ones who know of the location of the blue Key of Thirsha/ however/ so it is inevitable that you will have to find them.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, DS
#SAY, The most conniving of the clans may well be the black clan Darkswallow.  Of the clans most tended towards diplomacy/ the Darkswallows and the Whitethroats/ the Darkswallows are the only relevant ones to us because there are no known Whitethroats in this region.  Do not let their names fool you; the Whitethroats are no less treacherous/ and the Darkswallows can be cordial enough when it suits them to do so.  They have a city to the northwest/ in the mountainous regions.  Both clans are highly secretive/ and highly wary of one another.  The closest Darkswallow city is Blackscouge, in the mountainous region west of the northern deserts.  It may be useful to visit the city if you're in the area/ provided you watch your step.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, DEMONGUT
#SAY, Clan Demongut is a wanton and chaotic clan.  They care only for their own firey appetites/ owing little to honor or even strategy.  Nonetheless/ they are fierce warriors and intensely dangerous simply because of this ferocity.  The one reliable thing about the Demonguts is their animosity towards the Firebellies; the two have a feud that has stretched back as long as anyone can remember.  The Demonguts have a castle far to the north/ just west of Thirsha's Volcano and north of the Darkswallow city of Blackscourge.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, FIREBELLY
#SAY, Clan Firebelly is cruel and sadistic/ but cunning just the same.  It is possible to deal with them/ but their hunger often overrides any feigned friendship they may have with you.  Always watch the Firebellies--one moment in their lap/ the next in their belly/ so it is said.  They have an intense hatred for the Demonguts--the one time you can be assured of your safety is when they have these much more preferable enemies around.  There is a Firebelly city to the northwest in the volcanic region.  It is called Skinbane.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, GURG
#SAY, The Gurglemeisters are an odd group.  Sociable as a whole/ but still unsettling in their obsession with their own digestive tracts.  You'd best watch your step around them--they may swallow you just as a prank/ but they're not about to burp you back up and risk ruining the joke...We're not sure where the Gurglemeisters live/ that is if they have a city at all/ but several have come from the south.
#ADDCHOICES, CLANS

#BRANCH, THIRSHA
#SAY, I have heard of your quest to defeat Thirsha the dragon.  All my hopes go with you in your travels.  Know this--Thirsha is powerful indeed/ but she knows that there are some who could defeat her/ especially if the clans were to combine to hunt her down. Thus/ she has secured her lair with three magical doors/ each requiring a different key.  These keys have been scattered throughout the land/ requiring that whomever seeks to challenge her seek the keys first.
#CHOICE, And where are these keys?,KEYS

#BRANCH, KEYS
#SAY, The first key is said to be in a cave far to the south.  Last I heard the caves were filled with dangerous worms; giant fanged grubs that will pick yank a girl right off her feet and chomp her down right there. Sadly/ that may be the easiest key for you to get.  The other keys have found their way into the hands of the clans--the second key is held by Clan Demongut/ and the third is in the hands of Clan Velvet Intestine.  Neither may be willing to give them up for nothing.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,CLANS
#EXIT, Then I suppose I had best seek them out.  Farewell.

#EXIT, Farewell.

#BRANCH, FIREMAGIC
#SAY, "Fire magic is generally focused on destruction and flames.  Fire magic has the most powerful and numerous low-level attack spells of all the different magical schools.  Not only do you obtain firebolt at level 1, but you gain a powerful spell called Flaming Aura at level 2 that inflicts damage on all enemies who attack you.  At level 3 you gain Blaze, which shoots flame in all directions and is devastating at close quarters.  Later on you gain fireballs, which inflict damage over a wide area, and even the ability to summon fire elementals.  The ultimate spell of the Fire school is Supernova, a spell which creates an expanding sphere of flame that inflicts massive damage."

#EXIT, Thank you.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, SCHOOLS
#SAY, "Each 'element' of magic is essentially a style.  They are used as mental and emotional focuses for particular effects.  Thinking of a particular element tends to make certain magical effects easier, so most mages think of their magics in such terms.  Though there are other styles and schools, the most common are the elemental styles.  Fire and Air are the favorites of combat mages, with Fire being the more offensive of the two, and air being the more balanced.  Enchantresses and warriors prefer Water and Earth--Water is an enigmatic element that provides many enchantment abilities, and Earth is the ultimate expression of strength and endurance--combined, the two are both strongly associated with life.  More generic magic without an element is generally called sorcery or grey magic."

#EXIT, Thank you.  Farewell.


#BRANCH, RMAGIC
#SAY, "The most common non-elemental style is called sorcery.  It is the element of magic itself--sorcery grants spells that increase your spellcasting abilities, and include teleportation spells, charm spells, and some generic summoning abilities.  Grey magic is also called enchantment, and it focuses primarily on magics that improve items or stats.  It has the best set of enchantment spells of any school, but can do little else."

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about water magic?, WATERMAGIC
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about earth magic?, EARTHMAGIC
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about air magic?, AIRMAGIC
#EXIT, Thank you.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, WATERMAGIC
#SAY, "Water magic is unusually broad, as water has many uses and natures.  An interesting fact is that though acid is widely considered to be both fire and water, it falls under the water school of magic.  Water has a very inexpensive basic healing spell at level 2, some very useful but unpredictable enchantments, a weak but very inexpensive attack spell, and the ability to summon water elementals.  The ultimate spell of water magic is an enchantment spell that can give any article of clothing a regeneration bonus--when placed on multiple items of clothing, these bonuses can become incredibly high."

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about air magic?, AIRMAGIC
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about other magics?, RMAGIC
#EXIT, Thank you.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, AIRMAGIC
#SAY, "Air magic is the magic of air, light, and energy.  Air magic is a favorite of sorceresses, because it has a heavy spectrum of excellent attack spells along with several useful defensive and healing spells.  First off, it contains a large variety of lightning spells, many of which allow you to hit multiple targets.  The Air Aura you gain at level 2 aids you on dodging attacks.  At level 3 you gain healing light, which is an expensive but very effective healing spell.  At level 4 you gain chain lightning, and at level 5 you gain a spell that allows you to enchant a bow to give a bonus to your split arrow skill along with a teleportation spell.  Level 6 gives you lightning wave, and the ultimate spell lets you summon a lightning dragon."

#EXIT, Thank you.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, EARTHMAGIC
#SAY, "Earth magic is almost entirely defensive.  It has no attack spells, but is a favorite of warriors because it can increase the strength and endurance of anyone many times over.  The first level of Earth magic gives you aura of Earth, which not only increases your endurance and strength, but protects you from damage.  At second level you gain regeneration, which is one of the most powerful spells in any school, as it allows you to regain hit points much faster than the regeneration skill.  While weak when you first learn it, at higher levels this spell can make you all but invincible.  You gain the ability to summon Earth elementals at level 3, and at higher levels you gain the ability to enchant armor and weapons to make them stronger."

I have tired of my apprentices ending up as Naga-excrement. I can provide you with an enhancement for your mana potions for your trouble if you can destroy her for me.  Remember/ though/ that you'd have to fight through not only the reptile bog but also the cave itself.  I wouldn't recommend you try it unless you're already a powerful warrior.

#CHOICE, I don't think so.  I think you'd be sliding through her intestines before you even knew what happened.,MAD
#EXIT. Whatever. Goodbye.

#BRANCH, JOIN
#SAY, I would/ but I am forbidden.  A rival sorceress of mine/ a Darkswallow by the name of Rutara/ would instantly set upon me if I were to leave here.  And while I could handle her/  I have my doubts that I could defeat both her and Thirsha simultaneously.
#CHOICE, Whatever. Pansy.,MAD
#CHOICE, That's a pretty lame excuse. Honestly.,MAD
#CHOICE, Makes sense.  Can I ask you about something else?,QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, MAD
#SAY, How dare you speak to me in such a fashion.  I have half a mind to shrink you down and swallow you myself!  See if a few hours wallowing in my vomit would teach you some manners.  If only you weren't Tanna's little pet hero...
#CHOICE, Whatever/ bitch.  I'm leaving., BITCH
#CHOICE, Look/ I'm sorry.  Can I ask you something?,QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, MAGIC
#SAY, Magic is like any other combat skill. It has it's advantages and it's drawbacks. The advantage of magic is that you can attack beasts from a distance--the disadvantage is that if you don't kill it in the first few shots/ it's almost guaranteed to come after you with it's mouth wide open/ waiting to stuff you down it's throat where your spells won't mean a lot.  Most people cannot summon the concentration to cast spells while they're busy being digested.  There are a few ways to escape from a monster's belly besides squirming your way out--particularly scrolls and mercenaries.
#CHOICE, But what happens if a mercenary kills a monster while I'm inside it?,INSIDE

#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, SCROLLMEAN
#SAY, Well/ I don't think I even need to TELL you the benefits of using a teleportation scroll when you're about to be shoved down a monster's intestines.  Other than that/ only a few spells are directly helpful under such circumstances.  Most attack spells--even spells that flare out/ like Blaze--will appear just outside the monster/ failing to harm it.  We believe this must be some sort of interior defensive mechanism that monsters have to allow them to digest mages safely.  We do tend to wonder why this same mechanism doesn't protect them from external spells/ however...In any case/ superheating a monster you happen to be inside at the time might not be the best idea even if you could...
#CHOICE, What do you know about Black Magic in particular?,BLACK
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about White Magic?, WHITE
#CHOICE, Do you know anything about Grey Magic?, GREY
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#CHOICE, What can you tell me about White Magic?, WHITE
#CHOICE, Do you know anything about Grey Magic?, GREY
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, WHITE
#SAY, White magic is the magic of healing and strength.  I don't know much about it/ because as a sorcereress I rarely use it.  Most white magic involves regaining hit points/ but many white spells can make your attacks hit harder/ and there are even a few offensive white spells.
#CHOICE, What do you know about Black Magic?,BLACK
#CHOICE, Do you know anything about Grey Magic?, GREY
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, GREY
#SAY, Of course I know about Grey magic.  Grey magic is the magic of enchantment--changing things to suit your will.  Most enchantresses and other practitioners of the Grey arts focus on changing themselves/ making themselves faster/ stronger and smarter than they would be.  Many grey spells can also offer protection or defenses against monsters.  The downfall of Grey magic is that it possesses almost no direct offensive capabilities/ so you had best have another way to destroy your foes or all of your enchantments will be for naught.
#CHOICE, What do you know about Black Magic then?,BLACK
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about White Magic?, WHITE
#EXIT, Thank you.  That's all I need to know.

#BRANCH, BLACK
#SAY, Black magic is the magic of offense.  It is for those who tire of enigmatic means and decide simply to reduce their enemies to ashes.  Black magic is primarily attack spells/ but the Black school also contains many rituals which boost the caster's intelligence--increasing the potency of any spells cast henceforth.

#SAY, Clothing is your best protection against monsters/ short of actual armor.  It reduces the damage you take from beasts attacking you/ and can even absorb some of the acid in the unfortunate circumstance that you are swallowed by one.
#CHOICE, Swallowed!? Eww!!,EWW
#CHOICE, Go on.,MORE
#EXIT, I don't think that'll happen.  Well/ I have to go now.

#SAY, This does/ however/ mean that your clothes will eventually be digested by whatever beast has swallowed you.  A partially-digested set of clothing is not only atrocious-smelling/ but itchy and uncomfortable--and worth significantly less as far as stopping enemy attacks.  A shredded/ acid-soaked shirt is little defense against a set of claws.

#BRANCH, DIGEST
#SAY, Wake up/ girl.  The forest is full of creatures with only one thing on their mind: Food.  And their primary diet is girls just like you.  If you go out and fight them/ sooner or later one of them is going to gobble you up like a piece of lettuce.  And when that happens/ you'll be glad you're wearing plate mail in the meantime/ because it can take a while to force your way back out.  If you can/ that is.

#EXIT, Thank you for the information.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, DIGARM
#SAY, Unfortunately/ yes.  The beasts around here can digest practically *anything*/ but it will usually take a lot longer to digest armor than it would normal clothing.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions about armor...,ABOUTARMOR
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I wanted to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, BEST
#SAY, There are two things that go into armor's effectiveness: It's type and it's material.  Armorsmiths will tell you the armor rating of each piece of armor they show you.  You can use this to make a decision/ but keep in mind that certain items--generally the top-of-the-line pieces that are difficult to make--have a higher price than their armor value would reflect.
#CHOICE, Go on...,BEST2

#BRANCH, BEST2
#SAY, Ultimately/ though/ the effectiveness of the armor you can buy is limited by what it's made of.  Due to this damned monster blockade/ I have been reduced to using hardened leather hides to make my armor.  The City of Angels still has a decent supply of bronze/ however/ so you may be able to get some better armor there...if you can afford it.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions about armor...,ABOUTARMOR
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I wanted to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, DIFF
#SAY, The biggest difference is in the level of protection you can get.  Armor is almost always a better choice/ but is also pretty pricey by comparison.  There's also the question of fashion/ if you're into that kind of thing.  Functionally/ the only limit to armor is it's limited variety/ and it's price.  You can't buy a breastplate for the same ten gold you might by a bra with.  The closest thing is a halter/ but they're both a bra and a breastplate--good defense for a bra/ but you can't wear anything overtop of them.  They are one of the cheapest pieces of armor you can buy/ however...

#BRANCH, QUEST
#SAY, To the northwest is a temple.  It is called the Temple of Yppiz/ and is filled with a depraved cult who are raising a giantess.  They have been feeding themselves to her willingly/ and with each meal she grows larger/ stronger and more bold.  She has even begun venturing out of the temple/ and has eaten many of our guardswomen.  I can enhance your life potions if you are able to destroy her for us.

#CHOICE, What do you know about these Mora Plains?, MORA
#CHOICE, How powerful are these cultists?, CULTISTS
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, MORA
#SAY, The Mora Plains are home to a more powerful breed of monster than you might be used to.  Like the Forests/ it is filled with dangerous plant life/ but the lower humidity seems to have made the plants there more aggressive in seeking out living prey.
#CHOICE, How powerful are these cultists?, CULTISTS
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, CULTISTS
#SAY, They are powerful indeed.  So powerful that every time our guards have attempted to deal with them/ they have failed.  And by failed/ I mean been shit out by a cultist after being digested alive.  We have even observed magical acolytes in their cult--the novice ones fling fireballs at trespassers/ and the advanced have learned to vomit their own bile at the enemy--they don't even have to swallow you to start digesting you!  (The way she describes them/ it sounds as though they average about 16th level)
#CHOICE, Sounds dangerous.  How can I reach them?,REACH
#CHOICE, I'll consider it.  I had some other questions., MAIN

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, To the east is the Forest of Doubts/ which you've probably seen.  Directly south of here is the Forest Glade--an area that looks idyllic/ but is probably the most dangerous area directly bordering our city.  It is filled with sprites and other magical creatures--creatures that will enchant you with their beautiful eyes right before they ram you bodily down their throats.  To the west are the Mora Plains--slightly less dangerous/ but only slightly.  They're full of carnivorous plants--giant/ two-jawed monstrousities that will snap shut around a girl and start digesting her then and there.
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about this city?, CITY

#EXIT, No thanks.

#BRANCH, WHAT
#SAY, Scrolls are items that essentially cast spells for you.  It can be difficult to make your way through the Beast Central Station we call our home without any magical capabilities/ and if you're of a more physical bent/ scrolls allow you to make up for any lack of more exotic skills.  Even if you're already a mage/ scrolls can help in a pinch because they don't require any mana to cast them.

I also sell Teleportation scrolls/ excellent for getting treasure out of those hard-to-reach places.  I sell enhancement scrolls which can make you more powerful/ and I even sell All-Dye scrolls which/ when used/ will change the color of all the clothes you may be wearing.

#CHOICE, What's the difference between bronze and leather?, DIFF

#BRANCH, BRONZE
#SAY, Yes.  I personally manufacture several different defensive pieces/ all out of iron.  Unlike most armor/ some of mine is magical as well.
#CHOICE, Can I buy some?, BUYARMOR
#CHOICE, What's the difference between bronze and leather?, DIFF

#BRANCH, DIFF
#SAY, Iron is an actual metal/ unlike leather which is essentially just a very hard cloth.  As such/ it is far stronger and more durable.  Unfortunately/ despite the fact that it is practically the lowest rung of armor metals besides bronze/ even it is rare due to the monster blockades/ and so it's also more expensive than leather.
#CHOICE, Can monsters digest iron as easily as they digest leather?, DIGEST
#EXIT, I see.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, DIGEST
#SAY, Not usually/ but that doesn't mean they can't digest it.  It doesn't even mean they can't digest it quickly.  But it will generally take longer for them to digest a bronze or iron piece of armor than a leather one/ and the armor will thus continue to protect you longer.  The smell also doesn't tend to soak into metal as easily/ either...
#CHOICE, Ah.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN2
#EXIT, I see.  That will be all.

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, Because I have greater skill both in forging armor and in how to use it--my knowledge allows me to make my armor more comfortable/ not to mention effective.  Though there are a few other merchants in town selling bronze and even iron armor/ my armor is far superior both in quality and due to it's magical abilities/ so I am given much more to work with.
#CHOICE, What did you mean/ 'how to use it'?, HOW
#CHOICE, I see.  So you sell iron armor?, BRONZE
#CHOICE, Can I buy some armor from you then?, BUYARMOR
#EXIT, I see.  Perhaps I'll come back and test your merchandise sometime.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, HOW
#SAY, There is more to making the most of your armor than simply strapping it to your chest and wading into battle.  A true warrior knows how to move the right way to catch blows on the strongest plates/ and how to evade in such a way that claws and teeth deflect from plates rather than sink in.

The type of magic depends on the type of gem, but as a general rule, they have  a magical effect on anything that touches them.  If you place a gem in a piece of jewelry or clothing, you'll always be touching the gem and so you'll gain it's benefits until you remove it.  It's the same way with weapons--if you place a gem in a weapon, it will have a magical effect on you as long as you have the weapon in your hand."
#ADDCHOICES, JEWELQUESTIONS

#BRANCH, USEGEMS2
#SAY, "Mounting a gem on an item is fairly simple--many items have sockets built especially for gems.  If they do, simply place the gem in the socket and it will remain there.  (To add a gem or rune to an item, double-click on the gem or rune in your inventory, then double-click on the item you want to add it to.) It's almost impossible to get them out again, though, so make sure you want the gem in the item before you place it in there.  If they don't have any sockets, you'll need to add them.  Jewellers such as myself often sell socket kits that will allow you to add sockets to an item."
#CHOICE, "And how do these socket kits work?", SOCKETKITS
#ADDCHOICES, JEWELQUESTIONS

#SAY, "Socket kits function more like runes do.  Runes can be placed on any item, regardless of whether it has sockets.  Essentially, a socket kit is just a rune that adds a socket to an item.  They are added just like any other rune.  Socket kits are available from most jewellers, but they are kind of expensive."

#BRANCH, CLOSE
#SAY, Come re then.
#CHOICE, (More), CLOSE2

#BRANCH, CLOSE2
#TEXT, She takes your hand and pulls you close. Her hands explore your body eagerly caressing everything they find. She licks her way down your neck and sucks one of your breasts into her mouth and you moan as she lets it slide from her lips.
#CHOICE, Let her continue., CONTINUE
#CHOICE:INT:25, You take the initiative., LEAD

#BRANCH, CONTINUE
#TEXT, She kisses you deeply and passionately and before you know it you feel her tender muscles massaging you down her throat. She gives your orbs some special attention before they go down and when she reaches your hips and starts to eat you out as well as eat you up you are on the verge of an orgasm.  Skilfully she takes you over the edge and as your body spasms she slurps up the last of you.
#CHOICE, (More), CONTINUE2

#BRANCH, CONTINUE2
#SAY, Ahhh... That was wonderful/ you were by far the tastiest girl I've enjoyed in quite a while.

#BRANCH, LEAD
#TEXT, You let your hands caress her body and use your tongue to get a good taste of her before you let your lips slide over her head. You hurry to her chest so you can taste those yummy melons properly. Soon enough though they are bulges in your neck and your tongue trails down her tummy as an explorer looking for gold. Her generous hips fill your mouth and with them came that juicy snatch you were looking for. Ohh/ her taste is heavenly. When she erupts in your mouth you are unable to hold back anymore and greedily slurps up her slender legs.
#CHOICE, (Let her back up.), LETUP

#CHOICE:STR:35, (Digest her.)  , DIGESTHER2

#BRANCH, DIGESTHER
#TEXT, As you let your stomach have at her you sense her disaprovement and before you can do anything to stop her she has forced her way back up your throat/ well out she turns to you.
#CHOICE, (More), DIGESTHER3

#BRANCH, DIGESTHER3
#SAY, That wasn't nice! This is what I do to people who aren't nice!
#CHOICE, (More), DIGESTHER4

#BRANCH, DIGESTHER4
#TEXT, She opens her mouth wide as she gets a good hold of you/ then she crams your whole upper body into her throat/ which ripples and promptly sucks you down into her very unfriendly stomach. It has you liquefied in moments and as you slide through her intestines they greedily absorbs as much as they can/ before letting her expel what little is left.
#CHOICE, (Get squeesed out of Ardayna.),#DIGESTTO:DIGESTHER4:7

#BRANCH, DIGESTHER2
#TEXT, You let your stomach go at its prize. Your meal doesn't seem too happy about it/ but soon she's in no position to argue as she's sliding through your intestines.

#SAY, Hey! That's not nice! What did I do to deserve getting kicked like that from the inside? Well have it your way!
#CHOICE, (More), PANIC2

#BRANCH, PANIC2
#TEXT, The previously so gentle stomach quickly becomes the opposite/ it churns you hard and digestive juices seem to spray from all around/ filling the stomach to the brim in notime. Soon enough it has turned you into a nutritious soup and lets you over to the intestines to do their work. When they are done you are just a brown mushy mass.
#CHOICE, (Let Ardayna squirt you out.), #DIGESTTO:PANIC2:5

#BRANCH, OUT
#TEXT, The muscles all around you starts to press down on you harder and harder. Then finally you start you rise upwards/ entering her throat once more and then mouth/ which now gets to taste you a second time. She lets herself linger on the parts she liked going in and makes it almost as pleasant going out as it was going in. This also makes sure that you're not covered in goop/ only saliva as you drop onto the ground.
#CHOICE, Thanks/ that was wonderful/ but I have to go now bye., #CHANGESTART:MAIN3:OUT2

#SAY, I think I'd like that!
#CHOICE, (More), FAVOUR2

#BRANCH, FAVOUR2
#TEXT, You feel her stomach gently apply pressure on you and slowly you are brought back up her throat. She tastes you thoroughly before she lets you slide from her lips/ making it feel almost as good going out as it did going in.
#CHOICE, (More), LEAD

#BRANCH, LETUP
#TEXT, She squirms about pleasantly and after a while she wants to come back up. With her helping you soon have her re-entering your mouth and passing your lips/ only that it is from the inside and out this time. She collects herself and soon you are looking into those tantalizing eyes once more. She looks at you expectantly as she licks her sultry lips and caresses her tummy.
#CHOICE, Thanks/ that was wonderful/ but I have to go now bye., #CHANGESTART:MAIN3:OUT2
#CHOICE, Ehh/ you want me to go in there? (Point at her tummy.) Well sure..., CONTINUE

#CHOICE, My name is $NAME., #CHANGESTART:MAIN2:NAME2

#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, NAME2
#SAY, Nice to meet you/ $NAME.  What can I do for you?
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, MAIN2
#SAY, Good morning/ $NAME.  What can I do for you?
#CHOICE, Do you know where I can find any of Thirsha's Keys?, KEYS
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the Gurglemeister clan?, CLAN
#CHOICE, Why don't the worms in this cave eat you?, WORMS
#EXIT, Never mind.

#BRANCH, KEYS
#SAY, Yeah/ actually.  One of them is supposed to be in the cave west of here.  Unfortunately/ the worms in that particular cave have few qualms about ingesting poor/ succulent Gurglemeisters/ so we kinda keep out.
#CHOICE, Thanks.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3

#BRANCH, CLAN
#SAY, Well/ I can tell you that we like our food like we like our girlfriends--squirming and entirely helpless.  (She giggles)  Actually/ that's not entirely true.  The only real similarity between our girlfriends and food is that our girlfriends usually ARE food.
#CHOICE, Uh huh...anything else?, ELSE
#CHOICE, You eat your friends!?, FRIENDS
#CHOICE, I see.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#EXIT, Uh huh...I don't like where this conversation is going.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, FRIENDS
#SAY, Who better to have inside you than someone you like and admire?  And who better to be digested by than someone who cares about you?
#CHOICE, Who better not to be digested by?  How about NOBODY?, NOBODY
#CHOICE, Remind me to never get too friendly with you. Anything else?, ELSE
#EXIT, Ick.  I'm leaving.

#BRANCH, NOBODY
#SAY, Aw/ come on.  Being digested isn't really that bad.  Just ask Jeritia.  She LIKES it.
#CHOICE, Jeritia LIKES being digested!?, #ADDQUEST:Jeritia:JERITIA

#BRANCH, ELSE
#SAY, Well/ there is one other thing/ that you may have figured out already...as you know/ girls who get swallowed once too often tend to/ well/ start to like it.  I think this might happen to us faster than others.  We love to swallow things/ and a few of us even like to BE swallowed sometimes...especially Jeritia.  She's jumping down things' throats all the time...
#CHOICE, Jeritia LIKES being digested!?, #ADDQUEST:Jeritia:JERITIA

#BRANCH, JERITIA
#SAY, Yup.  Crazy/ ain't it?  If you're into being swallowed yourself/ or if you just want to mock her/ you could go talk to her...She's around here somewhere...
#CHOICE, With THAT kind of a hobby/ I'm very surprised she's not dead., DEAD
#CHOICE, Maybe I will.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#CHOICE, Sounds like somebody I would pay money NOT to have to talk to.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#EXIT, I think I've heard just about every fact about the Gurglemeisters that I can stand...goodbye.

#BRANCH, DEAD
#SAY, Actually/ she's supposedly refined the skill of escaping from monster's bellies to the point that she can wriggle her way out of almost anything.  At least/ she's wriggled her way out of everything so far...granted/ it's just a matter of time before she underestimates how strong some monster's gastrointestinal muscles are and ends up being squirted out the monster's business end as something less than she was...
#CHOICE, Probably.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#EXIT, Actually/ maybe she could give me some pointers on escaping from monsters...I've got to go.

#BRANCH, MAIN3
#SAY, What did you want to know?
#ADDCHOICES, MAIN2

#BRANCH, WORMS
#SAY, Who says they don't?  Personally/ I just think they eventually got sick of having the same old Gurglemeisters for breakfast/ lunch and dinner...Actually/ we've been breeding them to protect us from other monsters.  Some of our mages can actually control the worms/ but unfortunately their sheer numbers has begun to make our control more and more precarious...we already don't control any of the worms in the adjacent caves/ and every once in a while one of the worms will just turn around and gobble one of us right up...
#CHOICE, Why haven't you just killed them?, KILLED
#CHOICE, Ah.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3

#BRANCH, KILLED
#SAY, You haven't exactly looked around/ have you?  If we were to go to war with this many worms/ the only real threat we'd pose is that they would eventually starve to death because there weren't enough of us to go around.
#CHOICE, Well/ I'M not having much of a problem with them...Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#CHOICE, I can see your point.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN3
#EXIT, You're just wimps.  I'm outta here.







#CONVERSATION, Jeritia
#BRANCH, MAIN
#SAY, Yes?
#CHOICE, Who are you?, WHO
#CHOICE, Why do your people live in this worm-infested cave?, WHY
#CHOICE, What can you tell me about the Gurglemeister clan?, CLAN
#EXIT, That's all.  Thanks.

#BRANCH, CLAN
#SAY, We are the Gurglemeisters/ most intelligent and beautiful of all the clans and best cooks in all the known planets.
#CHOICE, Suuuuuuure.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN
#CHOICE, Cooks?, COOKS
#CHOICE, How do you get along with the other clans?, GETALONG

#BRANCH, COOKS
#SAY, You bet!  Nothing can compare to our exquisite Gurglemeister cuisine.
#CHOICE, Would that cuisine/ by any chance/ tend to have breasts and usually scream as you're eating it?, SCREAM
CHOICE, Where can I get some?, GETSOME
#EXIT, Ah.  I must be going now.

#BRANCH, SCREAM
#SAY, Ummm...well...er...(She points behind you) What's that!? (She runs away)
#EXIT, ...Well...that figures...

#BRANCH, GETALONG
#SAY, Basically/ we get along as well as they will allow us to...most take needless offence at our offers to let them explore the wonders of our digestive tracts.
#CHOICE, I wonder why.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN
#EXIT, Ah.  Must make you quite popular.  I've got to go now.

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, We haven't managed to build ourselves a real city yet.  This cave was originally mostly empty--it's just recently that the worms and the nagas have started crowding us in.
#CHOICE, Why aren't the worms eating you?, WHYNOTEAT

#BRANCH, WHYNOTEAT
#SAY, We've managed to cast a spell on them to prevent them from eating Gurglemeisters.  I'm not sure exactly how it works.  Apparently most of them are raised from birth on this spell/ so that they won't eat us...You'll have to ask someone else if you want to know more.
#CHOICE, Ah.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN

#BRANCH, WHO
#SAY, My name is Jeritia.
#CHOICE:IFQUEST:Jeritia, The Jeritia who gets off on being swallowed by people?, GETSOFF
#CHOICE, Pleased to meet you.  I'm $NAME.  Can I ask you some questions?, MAIN
#EXIT, Ah.  That's all then.

#BRANCH, GETSOFF
#SAY, My/ you're direct/ aren't you?  Well/ I'm the only Jeritia in town/ so I must be the one.
#CHOICE, I must just say that that is TOTALLY gross., GROSS
#CHOICE, What makes you enjoy it?, ENJOY
#CHOICE, How do you even survive a hobby like that?, SURVIVE

#BRANCH, ENJOY
#SAY, Just the feeling of sliming around inside a hot belly is so...stimulating.  It's incredible/ the way the chunks coat your skin/ feeling your limbs push into the spongy flesh...
#CHOICE, Did you know you're a very sick person?, GROSS
#CHOICE, Yeah/ but you sorta tend to get DIGESTED when that happens., SURVIVE
#EXIT, Eeewww.  I most DEFINATELY have to go now.

#BRANCH, GROSS
#SAY, Hey/ to each her own.  Actually/ I've heard most girls end up like me if they ever get swallowed one too many times...
#CHOICE, Not me.  I've been swallowed more times than Bill Clinton and it STILL grosses me out., STILL
#CHOICE, You know/ I did actually enjoy it once or twice..., MEENJOY
#CHOICE, Suuuuuuuure.  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN

#BRANCH, STILL
#SAY, Well/ maybe you just haven't been swallowed by the right thing.  Just find the sexiest/ most desirable woman you can find/ then piss her off.  I guarantee you'll enjoy what happens.
#EXIT, You are just too surreal.  I'm leaving.
#CHOICE, You know/ there were a few times where I WAS kind of curious what some of those girls felt like inside...,MEENJOY
#CHOICE, Um/ can we just change the subject please?, MAIN

#BRANCH, MEENJOY
#SAY, See?  Everybody denies it/ of course...I mean/ it IS gross/ but at the same time/ it feels so GOOD...
#CHOICE, The only problem is the whole 'Get-digested-and-die' thing..., SURVIVE
#CHOICE, Wierd/ ain't it?  Can I ask you something else?, MAIN
#EXIT, Yeah.  Well/ I gotta go now.

#BRANCH, SURVIVE
#SAY, Well/ the trick is knowing how to get out before they really start to digest you.  You've got to find the right footholds/ the right handholds/ and learn how to move your body properly so you can actually get somewhere without just sliding around in the slippery flesh.  It's an art form that few girls get the opportunity to master.
#CHOICE, I'm...sure it is.  Can we talk about something else?, MAIN
#CHOICE:SAYONCE, I'm almost afraid to ask this/ but could you teach me?, TEACH
#CHOICE, OKAY.  LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS., MAIN
#EXIT, Uh huh...I'm out of here.

#BRANCH, TEACH
#TEXT, Jeritia gets an unnatural-looking grin.
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH2

#BRANCH, TEACH2
#SAY, Why/ I'd be delighted! 
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH3

#BRANCH, TEACH3
#TEXT, Before you can protest/ or change your mind/ Jeritia has grabbed you and shoved you down her throat.  Just that quickly/ you find yourself inside her stomach/ filled almost to the brim with hot/ lumpy liquid.
#CHOICE, WHAT THE HELL!?  JERITIA!!, TEACH4
#CHOICE, I knew I shouldn't have even asked...,TEACH4

#BRANCH, TEACH4
#TEXT, As Jeritia's stomach starts to slowly churn/ you hear her voice from somewhere outside/ muffled by her flesh but amplified by your apparent proximity to her lungs.
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH5

#BRANCH, TEACH5
#SAY, Okay/ now the first thing to remember is not to panic.  It's a little known fact that many monster's digestive tracts are actually stimulated by the presence of struggling prey.  You must stay calm and take stock in your situation.
#CHOICE, TAKE STOCK!?  JERITIA/ I'M IN YOUR F#$@ING STOMACH!!, #DIGESTTO:TEACH6:1
#CHOICE, Um/ look/ I can't exactly take notes in here..., TEACH6
#CHOICE, Okay...I'm listening...please speak quickly..., TEACH6

#BRANCH, TEACH6
#SAY, The next thing to do is to form a plan of escape.  If your enemy's mouth empties right into it's stomach/ like with a frog or a Kari/ then the most important thing is just to get one or two of your limbs out of it's mouth to find some solid part of the monster's exterior to leverage against.  If your enemy is something with a long throat/ such as a snake or/ say/ me/ your job becomes a bit tougher.
#CHOICE, ALRIGHT!! POINT MADE!! LET ME OUT!!!, #DIGESTTO:TEACH7:2
#CHOICE, Can we hurry this up?  Your breakfast is beginning to fill my clothing., TEACH7

#BRANCH, TEACH7
#SAY, In cases like that you'll need concentration and a lot of brute strength.  And don't forget about your weapon--though it's well-known that it's impossible to cut your way out of a monster's stomach/ you can still use it as a makeshift crowbar in order to pry the predator's throat open., TEACH8
#CHOICE, JERITIA/ I'M GOING TO COUNT TO THREE..., #DIGESTTO:TEACH8:3
#CHOICE, By any chance/ have you been eating waffles?, TEACH8

#BRANCH, TEACH8
#SAY, Finally/ you should always try to use the stomach's natural movements to your advantage.  Concentrate on holding your ground when they push you towards the intestines/ and use any opposite movements to drive yourself towards the entrance to the throat or mouth.  If the stomach simply squeezes you downward/ use the tightness as a form of traction and use it to pull yourself upward.
#CHOICE, IIIIICK!! DO YOU KNOW WHAT JUST FLOATED PAST MY SHOULDERS!?, #DIGESTTO:TEACH9:3
#CHOICE, Yes/ funny/ your stomach DOES seem to be moving quite a bit..., TEACH9
#CHOICE, You realize I'm going to kill you when I get out of here., TEACH9

#BRANCH, TEACH9
#SAY, Well/ that's about it.  If you haven't been trying my advice so far/ I recommend you do so now.
#CHOICE, You mean you're NOT GOING TO LET ME OUT!?, #DIGESTTO:TEACH10:3
#CHOICE, (Try to escape), TEACH11

#BRANCH, TEACH10
#SAY, Come on/ I know you can do it.  Force your way out of my belly.  You don't want to wait until it shoves you into my intestines/ do you?
#CHOICE, AHHH! LET ME OUT!, TEACH13
#CHOICE, That does it...,TEACH11
#CHOICE, (Try to escape), TEACH11

#BRANCH, TEACH11
#TEXT, You struggle against her stomach/ using the techniques she 'taught' you.  Surprisingly/ they seem to work fairly well/ and you actually manage to pull yourself out of her stomach.  (You have gained one point in the Squirm skill.) As you flop to the dirt/ rivulets of vomit still trailing from your body to her chin/ she smiles.
#CHOICE, (MORE), #GIVESKILL:Squirm:TEACH12

#BRANCH, TEACH12
#SAY, See?  I knew you could do it.  Just follow my lead and nothing will be able to keep you down.
#CHOICE, (Attack her), #DIGESTTO:ATTACK:1
#CHOICE, Er...thanks/ I guess., #DIGESTTO:THANKS:1
#CHOICE, Don't you EVER do that again., #DIGESTTO:EVER:1

#BRANCH, TEACH13
#SAY, Huh didn't you listen to what I said? Well that's your problem.
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH14

#BRANCH, TEACH14
#TEXT, You squirm around as her stomach finally sets in. Done with the waffles it now takes on you and your struggling isnt helping you any. Jeritia was right you don't want to get sucked into her intestines/ but eventually you get just that. They quickly take care of you/ in the type of way intestines usually takes care of things.
#CHOICE, (MORE), TEACH15

#BRANCH, TEACH15
#SAY, Ahhh. I don't know if you were a complete moron or something/ but damn you knew how to squirm nicely. (Jeritia reluctantly takes her hands away from her wet groin as she crouches a little and grunts.)
#CHOICE, (Emerge from Jeritia's tush.), #DIGESTTO:TEACH15:5 


#BRANCH, THANKS
#SAY, My pleasure.  And if you ever want the *advanced* lesson/ just swing on by.  You might want to bring some antacids/ and maybe a sack lunch...
#CHOICE, Um...thanks/ I just might...,#CHANGESTART:MAIN3:SEEYA
#CHOICE, Um...thanks/ but no thanks...can I ask you something else before I go?,MAIN

#BRANCH, SEEYA
#SAY, Well I'll see you around then. 
#EXIT, Bye!

#BRANCH, EVER
#SAY, Aww/ come on.  You didn't even get to my intestines.
#CHOICE, You'll get to MINE if you ever think of something like that again.,EVER2

#BRANCH, EVER2
#SAY, Don't worry.  If I had really wanted to digest you/ I wouldn't have filled up on waffles first.  *tee-hee!*
#CHOICE, Uggg...can I at least ask you something else?, MAIN
#CHOICE, That's it.  You're going down., ATTACK
#EXIT, Laugh it up.  I'm leaving.

#BRANCH, ATTACK
#TEXT, Your revenge is rather swift.  You grab her face/ still oozing a little with her own digestive juices/ and shove it down your throat.
#CHOICE:STR:50, There.  See how YOU like it.  *BURP*, #EATME
#CHOICE:NOTSTR:50, There.  See how YOU like it.  *BURP*, ATTACK2
 
#BRANCH, ATTACK2
#TEXT, You feel Jeritia moving about in your stomach/ then suddenly she pops back up your throat and squeezes herself out of your mouth.
#CHOICE, (More), ATTACK3

#BRANCH, ATTACK3
#SAY, *Giggle* Mmm... That was nice. Did you try and eat me for real?
#CHOICE, Yeah!, YEAH
#CHOICE:INT:25, No/ ofcourse not., NO

#BRANCH, YEAH
#SAY, Oh... Well in that case it didn't seem like you knew what you were doing. I'll give you some pointers.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH2

#BRANCH, YEAH2
#TEXT, Just as before you hadn't time to react before you found yourself back in her warm liquid filled stomach.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH3

#BRANCH, YEAH3
#SAY, Firstly/ you have to make sure your meal doesn't escape from your stomach. A useful technique is to mach your stomach muscles work your meal down into the bottom of your stomach. This is also useful in another way as it is where your stomach juices will accumulate.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH4

#BRANCH, YEAH4
#TEXT, You feel Jeritia's stomach pressing and pushing on you hard/ forcing you down into her stomach almost making you drown in the juices there.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH5

#BRANCH, YEAH5
#SAY, Next you have to make sure you produce digestive juices that are up for the task. This is a bit tricky/ but generally you can't produce too strong juices so you just have to practice and then give your meals your best shot.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH6

#BRANCH, YEAH6
#TEXT, You hear Jeritia's stomach make all sorts of sounds and you feel the liquid level rising/ obviously she is making more. Soon enough you feel stinging all over as you start to melt away. The mush you've been turned into is then drawn into Jeritia's intestines.
#CHOICE, (More), YEAH7

#BRANCH, YEAH7
#SAY, That's how it's supposed to be done. *Snicker* Ohh/ you were yummy for my tummy/ waffles never quite do the trick.
#CHOICE, (End), #DIGESTTO:YEAH7:8

#BRANCH, NO
#SAY, *Giggle* Then you're not very good at controlling your stomach/ you need some serious practice.
#EXIT, I'll go practice then. Bye! (Get out of there before she realises you really did try to eat her.)

#BRANCH, MAIN3
#SAY, Hi again!
#CHOICE, Hello!, HI
#CHOICE, Could you give me that advanced lesson you were talking about?, LESSON
#EXIT, Hi Jeritia! (Keep walking.)

#BRANCH, HI
#SAY, What can I do for you...$NAME? It was $NAME/ wasn't it?
#CHOICE, Sure was. I was wondering if you could give me one of those advanced lessons you were talking about?, LESSON
#EXIT, Nothing really I was just passing by.

#BRANCH, LESSON
#SAY, I'd love to.
#CHOICE, (More), LESSON2

#BRANCH, LESSON2
#TEXT, Once more you experience just fast she can eat someone. One moment you are standing in front of her and the next you are being emptied into her stomach/ ending up almost swimming in all that was in there already.
#CHOICE, (More), LESSON3

#BRANCH, LESSON3
#SAY, I hope you've done your homework/ for this time I'm going to make it a little harder for you to come back out.
#CHOICE:STR:20, I think I have., LESSON4
#CHOICE:NOTSTR:20, Oh I forgot..., NOLESSON

#BRANCH, LESSON4
#SAY, We'll see about that. Just do what I told you to last time.
#CHOICE, (More), LESSON5

#BRANCH, LESSON5
#TEXT, You recall the last lesson she gave you and try to find the rhythm of her stomach. You realise what she meant when she said that it would be a bit more difficult this time. Her stomach is pushing you about a little more and it seems to generally be pushing you downwards and not just around/ which means getting up gets a bit harder.
#CHOICE:STR:26, (More), LESSON6
#CHOICE:NOTSTR:26, (More), NOHOMEWORK

#BRANCH, LESSON6
#TEXT, Eventhough it's harder you manage to get yourself back up her throat/ but as soon as you enter her mouth you find yourself being pushed back down into her stomach again.
#CHOICE, (More), #DIGESTTO:LESSON7:2

#BRANCH, LESSON7
#SAY, Good! That was just warmup. Now I'll make it a little more difficult. When you get into a trained stomach/ such as mine. You'll never get any pushes in any direction that you want to go/ so it's very important to get good holds and to get in the right direction when the stomach doesn't churn so hard on you. Yes that reminds me/ most stomachs gives you a harder beating than mine has so far/ so it's very important to brace yourself when not working towards the exit. Ok lets get things started.

The Demonguts have holed up in their castle to the northwest.  We have been unable to attack them directly/ because the Darkswallows claim every path through the area as their own and refuse to allow us passage.  We obviously cannot fight them both/ much as we would like to.  However/ that doesn't mean we can't still strike them a blow.

There is an old saying that describes most creatures in our world/ and it applies very well to them:  'they're not much more than pretty faces slapped on an elaborate digestive tract.'  Besides them/ there are also fire grubs and nightvines/ both of which are typically voracious but not often as dangerous.  To the southeast is the Volcanic pass/ which leads to the largely unexplored lakeland region.  This pass is guarded by full-fledged demonesses/ and we suspect it may also be part of the reason there are so many succubi in the area.

#SAY, Blackscourge is little more than an outpost.  The saturation of monsters in this region has prevented us from expanding/ but our guards have been able to keep the beasts out of our town.
#ADDCHOICES, QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, The mountains we have settled in here are treacherous/ to say the least.  Besides the jagged stone and obsidian that you must brave simply to walk around/ it is filled with a huge number of monsters/ just like every other area in this region.  There seems to be a particular concentration of centauresses and harpies around here--doubtless due to their unique ability to traverse the chaotic and rocky terrain.  Both subsist on a steady diet of travellers that try to make their way through the mountains.
#ADDCHOICES, QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, OTHERCLANS

As powerful as the guards in this town are/ they are only a trifle compared to the true might of Clan Darkswallow.  More cities belonging to our kind can be found far to the northwest/ but you would not be able to reach them due to the mountains.
#CHOICE, What is your relationship with the Firebellies to the east?, FIREBELLIES
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, FIREBELLIES
#SAY, The Firebellies are normally an aggressive and violent clan.  Unfortunately/ our proximity to Castle Demongut makes it most inconvenient to attempt to deal with both.  For that reason/ we have formed a treaty with the Firebellies.  We don't bother them/ they don't bother us.
#CHOICE, Does this treaty prevent the Firebellies from travelling to Castle Demongut?, PREVENT
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, PREVENT
#SAY, Yes.
#CHOICE, But then what's the point?  Why not just let the Firebellies attack the castle and do your fighting for you?, WHY
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, WHY
#SAY, Because the Firebellies are far too aggressive for their own good/ and they refuse to admit that the Demonguts have them outgunned.  At the moment/ only the threat of leaving their castle vulnerable to us prevents the Demonguts from marching their forces into Skinbane.  But if the Firebellies were to attack Castle Demongut themselves/ they'd be wiped out/ allowing the Demonguts to spread through the area at their liesure--and with that much territory/ they would begin to pose a serious threat.  But so long as the treaty holds/ the Firebellies won't attack us and neither will the Demonguts--neither wants to weaken themselves so much fighting us that they would be vulnerable to each other.
#CHOICE, So you're not protecting the Demonguts from the Firebellies...you're protecting the Firebellies from the Demonguts?, PROTECT
#CHOICE, Whoah.  That's kinda clever.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS
#EXIT, Thanks/ that's all I needed to know.  Farewell.

#BRANCH, PROTECT
#SAY, In essence.  We're satisfied so long as the two keep one another in check/ because this way we don't have to deal with *either* of them.
#CHOICE, Cool.  I had some other questions...,QUESTIONS

#BRANCH, SURVIVE
#SAY, It isn't easy/ believe me.  The succubusses alone are practically enough to make a quick brunch out of our entire town.  The best tactic I have discovered so far is to teach each of my disciples how to regrow their skin as quickly as possible/ granting them the survivability they need to come back from their guard shifts.

#CHOICE, I'm neutral/ actually.  My town didn't belong to any clan., NEUTRAL

#BRANCH, NEUTRAL
#SAY, Ah/ good.  Just stay that way and you'll stay out of trouble.  In any case/ back to your question.  We Velvet Intestines are not as belligerent or wanton as the other clans.  We find the tendency of other clans to constantly try to swallow their enemies whole to be a little childish.
#CHOICE, So you don't swallow girls?, DONT

#BRANCH, EAT3
#TEXT, She opens her mouth impossibly wide and bends down slightly/ bringing her throat to about shoulder level on you.  You enthusiastically put your hands together and start shoving them down her throat.  You feel the slick warmth of her esophagus on the sides of your arms as you push them deeper and deeper inside.  You take a step forward and place your head in her mouth/ then take another step that starts to push your face down her gullet.  She helpfully grabs your hips and turns you upside down at this point/ making your descent down her throat much easier.  You simply straighten your body and allow your weight to propel you down her throat.  You slide quickly through the slippery tube and into her liquid-filled stomach.
#CHOICE, (MORE), #DIGESTTO:EAT4:6

#BRANCH, EAT4
#TEXT, You curl up inside her hot digestive liquids/ grateful you can hold your breath as you feel the stomach walls begin to grind against your submerged body.  The euphoria continues as Lialyta's stomach sets about the task of thoroughly digesting it's huge meal.

#BRANCH, CITY
#SAY, This is the city of Allia/ regional home of the Velvet Intestine clan.  It is a colony from our holdings across the sea.
#CHOICE, Sea?  What sea would that be?, SEA
#CHOICE, Colony?, COLONY

#BRANCH, COLONY
#SAY, Yes.  This is hardly our clan's only city.  However/ the next closest holdings of ours are on islands to the southeast.
#CHOICE, Is there a way to reach these islands?, ISLANDS
#CHOICE, Ah.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, I see.  Goodbye.

#BRANCH, SEA

#CHOICE, Really? Is there any way to cross this sea?, ISLANDS

#BRANCH, ISLANDS
#SAY, Not in this game.
#CHOICE, Uh...okay...,MAIN2

#BRANCH, AREA
#SAY, We are situated just outside the edge of the Jungle of Pain.  The jungle is so named because it is infested with powerful beasts/ and practically every plant in the jungle has a digestive tract just about the right size for one of us.  Surrounding this area are the lakelands/ likewise filled with monsters/ as all of this region seems to be...
#CHOICE, You can thank Thirsha for that.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, Thanks.  That's all I needed to know.

#BRANCH, KEYS
#SAY, Yes/ actually...one of the keys was in our possession until a short time ago.
#CHOICE, Was?, WAS
#CHOICE, You mean it isn't now..., WAS
#CHOICE, Why does that not surprise me?, WAS

#BRANCH, WAS
#SAY, Unfortunately/ the key was carried by a girl named Matrynia.  She was with a party of village guard a few weeks ago when they were set upon by a swarm of unusually large harpies.  Only two of them made it back--the rest apparently became warm meals for their attackers.  One of them said she saw Matrynia fall into the great Groundmaw.
#CHOICE, Groundmaw?, GROUNDMAW
#CHOICE, Does that mean she's dead?, DEAD
#CHOICE, Is there any way to get the key back?, KEY

#BRANCH, GROUNDMAW
#SAY, Yes.  Groundmaws are essentially just giant stomachs buried in the ground.  They rely on unwary travellers simply falling into them/ though I've been told some of them hide themselves or have tentacles that they use to drag their prey into their bodies.  Truth be told/ nobody around here knows much about them/ because they're very rare in this region.  The only one we know of is in the Jungle of Pain to the east--but it's said to be one of the biggest in existance.  It's mouth isn't that big/ but once you get inside/ it's tremendous.  Enough to fit an army.  I don't know how they found that out/ but it means it might be possible to actually find an exit/ assuming you survive long enough...
#CHOICE, So Matrynia could still be alive?, DEAD
#CHOICE, Then how can I get the key?, KEY

#BRANCH, DEAD
#SAY, Well/ if Matrynia were still alive/ she would have made her way back here.  Though there may be a way to escape the Groundmaw/ it can't be easy.  I imagine there's a virtual sea of digestive juices inside.  To be honest/ I'm almost certain she's little more than a puddle of goop somewhere in the groundmaw's cavernous insides by now.
#CHOICE, Then how do we get her key back?, KEY

#BRANCH, KEY
#SAY, If Matrynia was indeed digested inside the groundmaw/ the key is all but lost.
#CHOICE, Could somebody go inside and get it?, GETIT
#CHOICE, Would the key have been digested too?, KEYDIGESTED
#EXIT, Well/ that would seem to fuck my quest.  Goodbye then...

#BRANCH, KEYDIGESTED
#SAY, Possibly.  Virtually nothing is indigestible to the monsters around here.  Even the strongest armor has been known to dissolve if it's in the digestive tract for long enough.
#CHOICE, Then what can I do?, DO

#BRANCH, DO
#SAY, I'd say all you can do is hope that the key WASN'T digested.
#CHOICE, Well/ even if it wasn't/ it's still inside that groundmaw!  How do I get it?, HOW
#EXIT, I suppose.  I'll go investigate further.

#BRANCH, HOW
#SAY, I'd say you don't/ unless you want to actually jump down the Groundmaw's throat and go after it.
#CHOICE, Is that possible?, GETIT
#CHOICE, I just might have to do that/ actually., GETIT

#BRANCH, GETIT
#SAY, Only if you're suicidal.  You'd have to be crazy to go in there.  No girls have come out of it for as long as I've been alive.  And that isn't to say there haven't been several dozen who have fallen in.  With as huge as that thing's insides supposedly are/ the key could be at the bottom of a hundred-foot-deep pool of gastric acid.
#CHOICE, But it might NOT/ and I really need that key., ANYWAY
#CHOICE, Er...do you know where I might get some scuba gear/ then?, SCUBA

#BRANCH, SCUBA
#SAY, Sorry.  Even if you could find scuba gear on this planet/ it could probably digest it anyway.
#CHOICE, Crapola.  But I need to go in there.  I NEED that key., ANYWAY

#BRANCH, ANYWAY
#SAY, Well/ I suppose if you're after Thirsha/ you would...Well/ good luck.
#CHOICE, So where is this Groundmaw?, WHERE
#CHOICE, Thanks.  I had some other questions...,MAIN2
#EXIT, Thank you.  Goodbye.

#EXIT, I'm sure.  Goodbye.
#BRANCH, NAGAS
#SAY, Occasionally a naga will wander in here looking for a meal/ but more often than not she will wind up slithering down the esophagus of one of our guards.
#CHOICE, Have you ever eaten a Naga?, NAGA
#BRANCH, NAGA
#SAY, Oh my/ YES! They squirm all the way down/ but can't kick. I look forward to guard duty and hope they do try to sneak in. Then I can get a tasty snake-girl snack!
#CHOICE, Have the Nagas ever succeeded in eating any of you?, EATEN

#BRANCH, EATEN
#SAY, Once in a while. It makes a great show/ though. One time my friend Jill and I were on guard duty when a Naga snuck up behind us. That snake-slut grabbed Jill's feet and slurped her down. When she had completely enveloped Jill/ I grabbed her tail and sucked it up like spaghetti. She was too stuffed to put up a fight. I could feel her moving around for hours until she just curled up into a ball and digested quietly. Serves that bitch right. I had always wanted to eat Jill.
#CHOICE, Well I hope that meal was worth it!, MAIN
#EXIT, Suddenly I get the idea it isn't safe to be one of your friends.  Goodbye.

#EXIT, (Exit) 

#BRANCH, LEAVE
#TEXT, You turn to leave/ but notice she has no intension of letting you do so. It only takes a few moments before you realise that you can't out run her or out manoeuvre her/ and you feel her hands grip you and her weight pushing down upon you as she forces you to the ground/ thus bringing the chase to an abrupt halt.

#TEXT, She smiles wide and licks her lips in anticipation as she sees your approval.

#TEXT, After a short fight her mouth clamps down over your head. You feel her suck you further in. A moment later only your kicking legs remain outside of her/ another few gulps and they are crammed into her stomach with the rest of you. You trash about in there/ but it is no good. To her you are just food/ and soon enough you are not even that/ since her body is done with you.
